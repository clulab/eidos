* ExampleGenerator - Output mentions and groundings for collection.
* HelloWorld - Just print a message to see if the build system is working correctly
* ShowOntologyVersion - Display the commit hash of the two most important ontologies being used to ensure that the library dependencies have been updated as intended.
* WMSeed - Extract from text files and display results nicely in one of the first every programs to use eidos.  This requires a separate configuration file, wmseed.conf.
