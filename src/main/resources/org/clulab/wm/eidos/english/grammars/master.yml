  # todo: result of, outcome of as triggers -- reverse direction rules
  # relate to as correlation trigger
  # maybe add temporal rules???

    # TODO: 'with X, Y...' sentences:
    # example: "With the high cost of production, food imports will further reduce farmers' chances to make a living from agriculture."
    # example: "With increases in poverty levels people become more vulnerable to climate change and other risks."
    # TODO: rules for 'become' where do modifications live? causality?
    # example: "With increases in poverty levels people become more vulnerable to climate change and other risks."
    # example: "There will be a small increase in crop diversity due to the need to combat the climate and market risks
    #            as both of these might become more volatile in the future."
    # TODO: correlation rules
    # example: "Significant decline in poverty will be associated with a decrease in family size and increase in non-farm income ."
