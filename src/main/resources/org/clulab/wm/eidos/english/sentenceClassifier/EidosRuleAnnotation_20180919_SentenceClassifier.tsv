in 2018 , outcomes could be even worse given the persistence of conflict , further deterioration in macroeconomic conditions and the exhaustion of household ’ s coping capacity .	1
since december 2013 , many pastoralists have depleted or lost their livestock assets due to the conflict .	1
vital civilian infrastructure , including health and education facilities , water points , markets , roads and airstrips , has been damaged , destroyed and shut down due to direct attacks , generalized insecurity , economic crises , and lack of resources and staff .	1
stock-outs of essential medicines communicable diseases are a concern throughout the country due to poor sanitation , lack of access to safe water and crowded living conditions .	1
also many people are unable to access their farms due to insecurity .	1
 trade routes to and from wau and raga are expected to remain open , but trade flows will be low and volatile due to ongoing insecurity along these routes .	1
staple food supplies from 60.0 % poor 31.6 % severe bor south and aboko to these counties of concern are being source : fsnms transported by a limited number of traders and the price of goods are extremely high on destination markets due to the risk premium .	1
livestock conditions were generally good due to adequate pasture and water availability .	1

south sudan : the 2016 rainfall seasonal analysis september 2016 south sudan seasonal analysis - 2016 highlights • the growing season of 2016 in south sudan started well due to early and favourable rainfall , with earlier than average or timely planting across most of western equatoria , greater bahr-el-ghazal , northern areas and upper nile .	1
ezo camp in western equatoria was formally closed in february 2016 due to insecurity , and humanitarian access to lasu camp in central equatoria has become extremely difficult due to deteriorating security in the area since july 2016 .	1
in northern bahr el ghazal , assessment findings show that farmers produced less in 2016 than in 2015 , with some areas being hard-hit by flooding and dry spells , in addition to the more than one million children under age 5 and some 339,000 pregnant and lactating women are now estimated to be acutely malnourished ,15 with rates continuing to rise due to conflict , displacement , food insecurity , disease , and lack of access to clean water and good sanitation .	1
the primary net enrolment rate is now 43.5 per cent , due to conflict , displacement , lack of trained teachers , inadequate supplies , and disruption of education services fuelled by the economic crisis .	1

furthermore , field information indicates a below average first harvest in central equatoria and continuous crop failure ( for second season ) in eastern equatoria due to dry spells and erratic rainfall .	1
in addition , always in former unity state , there is an elevated risk that famine is occurring also in former koch county , but it cannot be confirmed due to limited available evidence , while in former panyijiar county famine has been avoided so far only thanks to adequate humanitarian assistance .	1
below-average crop production estimated in 2016 due to insecurity and displacements harvesting of the 2016 main season crops was completed in january .	1

in the greater equatoria region , which is 6,000 normally the primary food basket for the country , food 5,000 security is expected to worsen unusually due to conflict and insecurity since july that has prevented the 4,000 population from accessing their farms .	1
in the greater equatoria region , food security is likely to worsen significantly due to the ongoing conflict that has led to displacement of the local population which has disrupted the second season cropping .	1
south sudan : the 2015 rainfall seasonal analysis september 2015 south sudan seasonal analysis - 2015 highlights • the growing season of 2015 in south sudan started well due to early favourable rainfall , with earlier than average or timely planting across most of western equatoria , greater bahr-el-ghazal , northern areas and upper nile .	1
onset of season and vegetation status the growing season has started earlier than usual in western areas ( western equatoria and greater bahr-el-ghazal ) as well as along the border with sudan and in upper nile state , due to good rains during the earlier stages of the season .	1
the ipc analysis released in february stated that from february to july 2017 , leer and mayendit were classified in famine , while koch was classified as ‘ famine likely to some of the clusters in wau country western bahr el ghazal could not be surveyed due to access challenges .	1
this plan however was not deemed sufficient for county wise results for nutrition , due to different sampling requirements for nutrition indicators .	0
in wuror county in jonglei , where nutrition results were desired at county level due to lack of smart surveys or other sources of nutrition data , a total of 450 households were allocated for the survey .	1
furthermore , due to the same reason , the number of households which could be surveyed in some counties were considerably less than the sampling plan .	1
about a quarter ( 26 percent ) cited changed market conditions as the reason while 10 percent thought it was the reduced value of money due to inflation .	1
reduced value of money due to cannot access inflation , 10 % work place , 4 % other , 4 % income source completely destroyed , 38 % work place closed , 2 % income source partially destroyed , 17 % market conditions have changed , 26 % 11 6 .	1
cropping conditions are generally favorable in most western areas and central areas due to good performance of seasonal rainfall since the start of the season .	1
although , the short-and long-term rainfall forecasts are favorable for agricultural areas of the western and central highlands , production of most crops is likely to be limited due to insecurity and lack of availability and / or access to farm inputs due to ongoing conflict .	1
livelihoods have been decimated by the conflict and economic decline , with livestock looted , killed and disease-prone and crops destroyed or planting delayed due to violence and displacement .	1
humanitarian needs and drivers some 967,000 children have lost access to education due to the crisis in south sudan.12 school-aged children represent more than 47.75 per cent of the displaced population.13 fighting and displacement have been the main drivers leading to interruption of education and lack of protection for 3-18 school enrolment by sex school enrolment by sex western equatoria no data available denotes a score of 0 this interruption of education will have immediate , medium and long-term consequences for the stability and development of the country as children who are not in school will lack the structure and stimulation for healthy cognitive and psychosocial development that a child ’ s developing mind requires .	0

children in urban and peri-urban juba struggle to access education due to closure of public schools because of limited government funding , while insecurity and conflict disrupted all education activities in lasu refugee camp in yei county .	1
sex and age disaggregated data is scarce due to the absence of accurate baseline data .	1
children under age 5 are particularly vulnerable to disease , including due to the low level of routine immunization and poor nutrition status .	0
women and children remain especially vulnerable to protection risks due to lack of shelter .	1
children under age 5 , and pregnant and lactating women are the most vulnerable groups to acute malnutrition due to their increased biological and physiological needs .	1
livestock have been looted or killed , crops have been destroyed , and planting has been delayed due to violence , displacement and unfavourable weather .	1
living conditions in these sites remain dire due to heavy congestion that exposes the idps to risks including mental health , disease , insecurity and protection , particularly for women and girls .	1
the depressed economy will also compound needs and reliance on assistance due to lack of opportunities for employment .	1
in urban areas , people struggle to access safe water due to ever-rising prices .	1
people living in poc sites and collective centres depend on a consistent supply of safe water , sanitation and hygiene services , and the displaced communities living outside of pocs are frequently deprived of wash support due to access containts and insecurity .	1
of the 1,893 health facilities , 419 ( 22 per cent ) are non-functional , and 955 are functioning at 10 per cent of their capacity due to a combination of extensive looting and vandalization , critical loss of human resources , frequent stock outs of drugs and pharmaceuticals , and fiscal delays .	1
there is a considerable gap in shelter improvement due to continuous arrival of refugees and general population growth in camps .	1
giews country brief south sudan reference date : 14-september-2017 food security snapshot  famine phased out , but food security situation still dire across the country  food insecure caseload estimated at record high 6 million in june 2017  unfavourable prospects for 2017 crops due to widespread insecurity , large scale displacements and fall armyworm infestations  food prices at exceptionally high levels famine phased out , but food security situation still dire according to the latest ipc analysis , famine conditions , previously reported in february 2017 in former leer and mayendit counties in former unity state , were no longer occurring by late june 2017.overall , the number of people facing ipc phase 5 : “ catastrophe ” food security conditions declined from over 100 000 in february to about 45 000 in june due to sustained multi-sectoral humanitarian assistance operations and the two counties are currently classified as ipc phase 4 : “ emergency ” .	1
in the traditionally surplusproducing areas of southern greater equatoria region , crop production is expected to be lower than the already poor 2016 output due to recent massive displacements outside the former central and eastern equatoria states .	1
sharply reduced crop production expected in 2017 due to conflict and pest outbreaks in southern bi-modal rainfall areas , harvesting of first season crops was concluded in august .	1
most likely food security outcomes famine early warning systems network 14 south sudan food security outlook october 2017 to may 2018 food insecurity is expected to persist in all counties of concern between october and january due to little or no harvest , limited physical access to markets , and insecurity that is limiting the ability of many households to move in search of typical food sources such as fish and wild foods .	1
similarly , few traders are bringing supplies to raja due to both insecurity and seasonality .	1
the delivery of assistance has also been inconsistent in nyirol , uror , and canal due to the ongoing insecurity .	1
in northern mayendit , some households have fled from thaker , tutnyang , and rubkuay payams to neighboring counties due to the presence of armed groups .	0
fsnms data indicates that 95 percent of households in raga and 72 percent of households in wau planted for the season , though ground information indicates cultivation only took place near homesteads due to insecurity and lower than normal access to seeds and tools .	0
few households will sell livestock during the outlook period due to lack of access to markets , low demand for livestock , and little to no cash in circulation .	1
this is in part due to limited access to usd , which has made it difficult for traders to import food .	0
conflict in warrap is also likely due to high tension in gogrial west and gogrial east and the proximity of these counties to ongoing conflict in lakes .	1
aquaculture systems are likely to experience some benefits from climate effects through increased food conversion efficiencies and growth rates of fish under higher water temperatures , an extended growing season , and a larger potential range for aquaculture operations at higher latitudes due to reductions in sea and lake ice cover ( 8 , 119 ) .	1
nearly two million have fled south sudan due to its ongoing conflict , the worst­ever since it gained independence from neighbouring sudan in july 2011 .	1
idps wait to receive food rations and other items according to the ex­commissioner , government was incapable of doing much to avertfrom the wfp at a distribution point in pibor town , the situation due to the ongoing war in country .	1
the ex­mayom county commissioner , charles machieng kuol said majority of those affected fled to warrap , central equatoria state and neighbouring sudan due to lack of food .	1
 the western bank of former upper nile state is experiencing emergency ( ipc phase 4 ) food insecurity , mainly in manyo , panyikang , and fashoda where large displacements have occurred due to ongoing armed conflict .	1
additionally , tension remains high in parts of jonglei , lakes , and warrap , where inter-communal clashes have occurred , and in central and southern unity , due to the resurgence of various armed groups and an uptick in cattle raiding .	1
this suggests all classes of stock are generally in good body condition due to abundant forages and plenty of water through the season until december .	1
in november 2015 , national food inflation dropped by over 30 percentage points , likely due to the arrival on main markets of the bulk of recently harvested grain crops .	1
about half of distribution took place in conflict-affected states of jonglei and upper nile , while no quantities were distributed into unity state due to lack of humanitarian access ( table 5 ) .	1
conversely , the estimated cereal area in western and eastern equatoria states has decline due to lower number of farming households and lower planted area per household due to insecurity and / or unfavourable weather conditions .	1
lakes state taskforce teams undertook a harvest assessment mission in december as earlier planting mission were thwarted by insecurity due to a breakdown in law and order in most counties .	1
due to the fall of the value of the local currency in 2015 , prices of hand tools have more than trebled in most local markets increasing from ssp 15 per unit to ssp 50 or above .	1
production production estimates have been made on the basis of time-series information , adjusted to accommodate less that timely practices due to insecurity .	1
first of all , traded volumes of food have declined in most markets due to the high and rising prices and the low purchasing power of local consumers .	1
western bahr el ghazal state has also seen renewed influx of idps , estimated at around 40 000 people in wau town by end of january 2016 due to the emerging incidences of violent conflicts in previously secure locations .	1
vaccination programmes were conducted around the towns earlier in the year and then discontinued due to insecurity .	1
although oil production may increase in 2016 due to the implementation of the august 2015 peace agreement , if international oil prices continue to be extremely low and transit fees are not renegotiated down with the sudan , oil extraction activities may be a net economic loss for the country and oil fields shut down could become an inevitable option .	1
since early 2015 , prices recorded an increasing trend with a marked volatility , due to high general inflation and market disruptions due to insecurity .	1
in 2014 , cereal production in greater equatoria region resulted in an aggregate surplus of about 115 000 tonnes , while this year the surplus shrunk to only about 15 000 tonnes , due to negative effects of both unfavourable weather conditions and worsening security conditions .	1
in addition , sustained migrations flows from urban to rural areas due to conflict and insecurity have contributed to some localized increases in planted area .	0
in particular , in yambio , prices of goats , after having steadily and sharply increased in the first semester of 2015 ( +84 percent between january and june ) , plunged by 72 percent between june and august most probably due to distress sales after the upsurge in violent conflict in may .	1
conversely , the disturbances in market and commodity supply due to conflict , led to a decrease in importance of markets as a supplier of sorghum to households : lean season ( february-june ) market dependency in 2014 and 2015 has been the lowest since records began .	1
however , although rainfall distribution was conducive to mechanised farming , the following factors have reduced the area under cultivation :        sudan-based farmers have not ventured south this year due to insecurity .	0
as shown in figure 10 , goat prices ( male medium size ) , following seasonal patterns , peaked in september / october 2015 at the end of the rainy season as body conditions improved due to a good pasture and water availability .	1
this year , no attempt has been made to extrapolate changes in population for small ruminants due to fewer returns containing indicators in the case-studies conducted by the taskforce teams .	1
experience throughout south sudan noted during cfsams over the past 10 years suggests that such schemes are untenable due to low repayments , and , resources dwindle unless the funds are recharged every year by the donors .	1
ipc in south sudan ipc alert , issue 9 , 6 november 2017 the food security situation continues to be hampered and deteriorating due to prolonged conflict , displacement , humanitarian access constraints , climatic shocks and macro-economic instability .	0
south sudan : the 2015 rainfall seasonal analysis november 2015 south sudan seasonal analysis - 2015 highlights • the growing season of 2015 in south sudan started well due to early favourable rainfall , with earlier than average and timely crop planting across most of western equatoria , greater bahr-el-ghazal , northern areas of the country , primarily in upper nile .	1
one major factor contributing to food insecurity in south sudan is the absence of wellfunctioning markets in the country due to inadequate infrastructure , warehousing , price information , and other market institutions .	1
since that time , south sudan has continued to face fiscal pressures due to a fall in oil production and the recent decline in international oil prices ( table 2.4 and figure 2.1 ) .	1
subsequently , due to the internal conflict that began in december 2013 , there has been an exodus of 872 thousand people from south sudan .	0
sorghum prices tend to peak in january and fall steeply by may , most likely due to the first-season harvests in southern south sudan and in uganda .	1
moreover , market functioning is limited due to information asymmetry ( not all buyers and sellers have the same information ) , unequal market power ( large farmers and traders may have more access to credit , transport , and storage ) , and high search costs ( in linking buyers and sellers ) .	0
there is very limited storage capacity due to conflict .	1
in 2008 , the provincial government of south sudan created a national food security stock of sorghum , but donor support for this effort was canceled only one year later due to misuse of funds , resulting in a loss of more than us $ 4 billion .	1
intensive and abnormal migrations due to insecurity have seriously depleted the health conditions for animal health throughout the country .	1
inter-communal conflicts rooted in tribal and ethnic associations are on the rise due to changes in local power structures and the existence of factional militia in some areas .	0
key recommendations for increasing resilience to production shocks at global and local levels we have argued that the risk of a serious weather-related shock to global food production appears to be increasing rapidly due to climate change .	1
it also means the food system is more vulnerable to a sudden reversal in connectivity , for example due to an outbreak of trade restrictions .	0
farms become less competitive with imports due to a high renminbi , aging rural workforce and increasing labour costs .	0
poor food consumers in china would likely be relatively unaffected due to government intervention to buffer these households from food price inflation through the use of strategic reserves and price controls .	1
in addition , in biomadal rainfall areas , planting of the second season crop is ongoing with some challenges due to insecurity situation mainly in greater mundri counties , tombura , maridi ( western equatoria statee ) and yei , lainya , yei , morobo and part of kajo-keji and juba where farmers are displaced and cannot access their farm lands .	1
thousands of people were forced from their homes in 2015 due to violence and instability .	1
borehole repairs have not been possible in areas hardest hit by conflict , including large swathes of upper nile , due to lack of access due to insecurity and lack of technical expertise and supplies .	1
prices climb steadily from 2020 , and then rise rapidly in 2024 and 2025 due to instability in the middle east .	1
water-borne disease have spread due to displacement and overcrowding .	1
this includes new caseloads in the greater equatoria region – south sudan ’ s breadbasketthat have been cut-off from planting and harvesting their crops due to conflict in 2016 .	0
➤ ➤ harvests between september and december are expected to be well below average due to widespread insecurity and limited area for cultivation .	1
overall , in february , staple food prices in juba were between 2 and more than 4 times their levels in february last year , due to insecurity , a tight supply situation , hyperinflation and a significant depreciation of the local currency .	1
overall , in april , staple food prices in juba were between two and more than five times their levels in april last year , due to insecurity , a tight supply situation , hyper-inflation and a significant depreciation of the local currency .	1
the anticipated food crisis is mainly attributed to the south sudanese population ’ s inability to plant or harvest due to war that has displaced millions of people .	1
there were considerable constraints in field survey , in various areas due to prevailing insecurity .	0
 in kenya , the shortened length of the main growing season , due in part to a delayed onset of seasonal rainfall , couple diwht long dry spells and below-average rainfall is resulting in below-average production prospects in large parts of the eastern , central , and southern rift valley .	1
the already limited resources of host communities have been further depleted , and in many instances exhausted , due to accommodating idps .	0
during the dry season , insecurity along the main supply routes is a major challenge restricting movement and increasing transportation costs due to a high risk operational environment for transporters .	1
reduced cereal production , especially in the ‘ bread basket ’ regions due to conflict , and the increase in disease outbreaks and other seasonal and climatic shocks such as floods , drought spells and crop and livestock diseases and pests , including the fall army worm infestation , have also further undermined people ’ s resilience by depleting household assets .	0

of great concern is greater baggari , to which humanitarian actors have not had regular access since march 2017 , due to ongoing conflict .	1
 due to above-average rainfall from june to september , pasture and water resources will be above average .	0
nearly half of the population remains in crisis ( ipc phase 3 ) or worse due to this and severely limited livelihood options to access other sources of food .	1
the most immediate consequence of drought is a fall in crop production , due to inadequate and poorly distributed rainfall .	1
however , this percentage breakdown is not universally applicable to product availability due to regional differences .	1
average annual yields in 2015 are estimated to decline across the region if compared to previous year , particularly in eastern equatoria state and juba and terekeka counties in central equatoria state due to unfavourable weather .	0
these factors , together with increasing transaction costs due to supply-chain bottlenecks caused by the conflict , have driven up prices of imported commodities .	1
declining income earnings in urban areas due to reduced job opportunities have significantly cut remittance transfers to rural areas .	1
- 38 figure 10 : south sudan - retail prices of goats in selected markets ( medium size male ) normally , the terms of trade for pastoralists show great variations across markets due to high market fragmentation .	1
cereal prices increased 3-5 times in 2015 following the sharp devaluation of local currency in the parallel market and the increasing transport costs due to high fuel prices , multiple formal and informal taxation and insecurity along roads .	1
sorghum and maize account for most of the country ’ s domestically produced cereal , but there is little marketable surplus due to small farm size , low productivity , and weak market incentives for sales .	1
therefore , strengthening disease prevention measures may contribute to improvement of the nutrition situation in south sudan .	1
macroeconomic crisis driving food insecurity the ongoing macro-economic crisis , which has been further worsened by the conflict and insecurity , has contributed to food insecurity levels that have steadily increased over all seasons since 2014 reaching the highest peak ever during the lean period in 2017 .	1
in kenya , a late start to the season and extended dry spells have led to reduced crop yields and poorer than usual crop production prospects .	1

the resumption of conflict in april 2015 led to the closure of 80 outpatient therapeutic programme and 91 therapeutic supplementary feeding programme sites in unity and upper nile states between april and june , cutting off access to treatment for more than 5,600 sam and nearly out of of 50 counties surveyed in 2015 , 17,500 mam children .	1
the conflict in greater upper nile has disrupted livestock migration patterns , contributing to new patterns of natural resource-based conflicts between cattle keepers and settled farming populations , including in the equatorias and warrap state .	1
these early wetter than average conditions will have a positive impact on the start of agricultural season and will lead to an early start of planting and cultivation .	1
the depreciation of the south sudanese pound against the us dollar ( according to informal market exchange rates ) has contributed to rising food prices and to fuel and food shortages .	1
food assistance to these will contribute to increased access to care and adherence to treatment , and to reduced default rates of the programme .	1
this latest round of hostilities has seen large scale destruction and contributed to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people during the planting season .	1
school attendance also contributes to protection as it reduces exposure to forced recruitment , gender based violence , child labour and early marriage .	1
fuel shortages have constrained activity and led to theft and insecurity , while long gaps and inconsistency in salary payments to public sector employees have impacted the provision of health-care and education services , and the rule of law .	1

the inclusion of only documents in the english language in the review may have led to a degree of se - acknowledgments .	1
this exclusion may have led to a selection bias and therefore an underestimation of the overall climate-related impact on childhood undernutrition .	1
undernutrition during pregnancy is estimated to contribute to 800,000 neonatal deaths annually and to cause 20 % of stunting in children under age 5 y ( 13 , 17 , 18 ) .	1
in turn these diseases lead to or worsen undernutrition , creating an ominous vicious circle .	1
however , recent conflict has led to the looting of assistance and disrupted deliveries , and it is now expected that conflict will continue to disrupt the delivery of planned assistance in these counties .	1
in addition to the effects of a changing climate , agronomists anticipate that increasing co2 concentrations will lead to complex changes in the composition of weeds and the strength of plant defenses against pests and pathogens ( 33 , 152 ) .	0
warming may lead to increased stratification of oceanic layers and reduce the upward flux of nutrients into the euphotic zone ( the surface layer of water where photosynthesis can occur ) , leading to spatiotemporal variations in net primary productivity of phytoplankton ( 22 , 34 , 45 , 86 ) .	1
warming leads to reduced long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid content in phytoplankton ( 66 ) and in cold-water pelagic fish , such as sprat and anchovy ( 114 ) .	1
a recent meta-analysis quantifying the benefits of such changes found that simulated adaptation led to crop yields that were 7 – 15 % higher than yields in the absence of adaptation .	1
such high-intensity conflict and associated population displacement would likely lead to more acute undernutrition , in addition to other health burdens .	1
this leads to either reduction in supply or an increase in demand , which then drives up world prices .	1
depreciation of the dollar leads to cheaper prices in other currencies .	1
second , there is evidence that high food prices and lack of access to food have contributed to political instability and civil strife .	1
when national governance fails , as in the case of somalia , conflict can lead to large-scale food insecurity or even famine .	0
for example , supporting agriculture based livelihoods , ensuring effective coverage of social protection systems , addressing issues of land tenure and of access to natural resources , and fostering employment opportunities for youth can effectively contribute to peacebuilding and post-conflict recovery .	1
in a context where a new emergency or the further deterioration of the situation might lead to an increased risk of famine , or when the occurrence of famine has been declared , this aspect is particularly highlighted in the cover map and narrative of the report with respectively two categories : “ risk of famine ” and “ famine declared ” .	1
below-average precipitation across afghanistan ’ s 2017-2018 season could lead to a second consecutive below-average harvest season .	1
for fisheries , however , the compounding complexity of how the entire marine food chain will be altered leads to perhaps even greater uncertainty .	1
in addition improved agricultural and forestry services shall become a driving force for south sudan national socio­ economic development .	1
while poverty is undoubtedly a cause of hunger , lack of adequate and proper nutrition itself is an underlying cause of poverty .	1
as clearly indicated in the literature , violent conflict is the major driver of food insecurity and malnutrition , both acute and chronic .	1
the same study also found that drought affects conflict by causing changes in livestock prices , and suggests that droughtcaused livestock price shocks are a main driver of local conflict .	1
as the south sudan crisis enters its fourth year , an increasing number of children are at high risk of chronic malnutrition ( two years or more ) , which leads to irreversible cognitive impairments .	1
in the south-east of south sudan , there is increased likelihood of above normal to near normal rainfall , linked to el nino enhanced rainfall during the short rainy season in kenya and southern ethiopia .	1
“ hunger is being experienced across the state in almost all counties because the first crops that should have helped people dried because of long drought and seriously affecting people , ” he added .	0
agricultural activities continue to be affected by the protracted and widespread insecurity , which is constraining access to fields and is causing large-scale displacement of people , input shortages and damage to households ’ productive assets .	1
despite favourable rains across the country , except in the eastern greater kapoeta region , crop production has been severely affected by increasing displacements and insecurity , following the renewed conflict in july , that disrupted agricultural activities , including harvesting .	1
conflict and insecurity spreading across the country have cut off trade routes and continue to impede commercial imports .	1

• a developing el nino event and pessimistic forecasts for september to december rainfall in the northern half of the country , raise the possibility of drier than average conditions affecting late maturing crops in lakes , west bahr-el-ghazal and upper nile .	1
while the food warrap based coping strategies can be seen as a proxy of their current severe food insecurity , the weq livelihood based coping strategies , particularly lakes the emergency and crisis strategies practiced by households are likely to erode their resilience nbeg and thus have possible long term consequences .	1
as reported by the households , an average farming household in south sudan currently can produce food sufficient for their own consumption needs for only 3.2 months of the year .	0
the precarious food security situation in the face of such shocks , led households to resort to a number of coping strategies .	1
week 1 gfs-rainfall forecast ( mm ) , valid until august 17 , 2017 the expected intensification of seasonal rains over northern uganda is expected to help gradually ease rainfall deficits that developed earlier in the season .	1
in addition , heavier than normal rainfall is increasing the risk of flooding in many of the floodprone areas .	1
persistent heavy rains in the ethiopian highlands , eastern sudan , and south sudan , coupled with highly saturated soils in these areas , is likely to cause flooding in flood-prone areas , as is typical in august .	1
in the coming weeks , the seasonal rains are expected to intensify and may help ease the current dry conditions in parts of western darfur .	1
these continued rains could also reduce the impact of fall armyworm , for which infestations have been reported in six regions of ethiopia .	1
meanwhile , in greater equatoria , favorable rainfall since the start of july has enabled agricultural households to begin sowing .	1
the elderly and infirm face increased risks of being left behind and separated from their families in case of displacement .	0
the most acute needs remain in unity , upper nile and jonglei , but inter-communal fighting in lakes and western equatoria is also driving displacement .	1
06 conflict , insecurity , market disruption , economic downturn and localized crop failures have caused record high food prices and hunger has spread to locations that were previously stable .	0
humanitarian partners will also focus on improving availability of sex and age disaggregated data .	1
the protracted conflict in south sudan has compounded the wash needs of an already vulnerable population .	1
the conflict has compounded an already dire health situation and caused a major public health crisis disrupting essential primary and secondary health care services .	1
despite the signing of the peace agreement , fighting has yet to cease and shifting front lines continue to cause people to flee multiple times .	1
in the states and areas where education continued , the quality of teaching deteriorated due to missed opportunities to train teachers , delays or cessations in salary payments to teachers and inadequate capacity of existing systems to address complex psychosocial trauma .	1
the primary net enrolment rate in south sudan decreased from 42 per cent in 2013 to 35 per cent in 2015,10 as a result of disruption of education services due to conflict and displacement , as well as lack of facilities , trained teachers , supplies and funding .	1
however , the constant influx of new arrivals has meant that over 100,000 people across all sites have been forced to share a shelter with another family .	0
more than 2.3 million people one in every five people in south sudan - have been forced to flee their homes since the conflict began , including 1.66 million internally displaced people ( with 50 per cent estimated to be children1 ) and nearly 646,000 refugees in neighbouring countries .	1
diseases endemic to south sudan continue to cause death and illness .	1
malnutrition has spiked as a result of lack of access to safe water and sanitation , increasing disease rates , rising food insecurity and conflict .	1
stock-outs of essential medicines are likely to exacerbate the already dire health situation , as health facilities are likely not to have access to lifesaving essential medicines into early 2016 .	1
the continued increase in malnutrition has been driven by rising food insecurity , increasing spread of endemic diseases ( malaria , global acute malnutrition malnourished children under age 5 source : nutrition cluster , oct 2015 plw 312,200 mam 454,900 - severity map + upper nile abyei northern bahr el ghazal unity warrap jonglei lakes humanitarian needs and drivers source : nutrition cluster , oct 2015 sam 231,300 western bahr el ghazal acute malnutrition mostly affects children under age 5 and women , as well as other vulnerable groups including the elderly and hiv and tb patients .	0
ongoing perceptions of insecurity continue to prevent people from moving out of the poc sites and may cause additional influxes , particularly in malakal and bentiu .	1
the rising cost of living and impact of the conflict have also undermined people ’ s ability to access safe water .	1
food insecurity and con ict are also forcing many families to leave south sudan for neighbouring countries .	1
 we are very worried to see that food insecurity is spreading beyond con ict areas as rising prices , impassable roads and dysfunctional markets are preventing many families , even those in towns and cities , from accessing food ,  said fao country representative serge tissot .	0
further , the prolonged conflict , the impact on markets , the disruption of livelihood activities and the continued depletion of household assets have diminished the gap between most idp and host communities in the three conflict affected states .	1
the food and agriculture organization of the united nations ( fao ) helps farmers , pastoralists and fishing communities to increase their food production and income ; the office of the united 5 nations high commissioner for refugees ( unhcr ) leads assistance to refugees ; and the international organization for migration ( iom ) provides camp management and support for internally displaced persons ( idps ) and returnees .	0
enlisting a third party to monitor wfp activities in inaccessible areas may heighten exposure to the risk of fraud , corruption and collusive practices .	1
the current number of concurrent corporate emergencies has increased pressure on staff available to support operations .	1
help desks are set up during distributions , market monitoring informs decisions , and a hotline has been created for both beneficiaries and traders .	0
significant changes in the livelihood context of rural households in the greater upper nile region have further eroded the coping strategies of affected populations .	1
to mitigate this risk , the country office has significantly augmented its fundraising activities and staff capacity .	0
furthermore , the continuous conflict is gradually eroding away the seasonality of food insecurity in the three conflict affected states .	1
the negative impact of the conflict on the economy further exacerbates the already desperate living conditions of millions of vulnerable south sudanese .	1
this tool will enhance the ability of wfp to provide evidence-based data for achievements while also enabling the country office to more easily track project plans against various funding scenarios and signed partnership agreements .	1
climatic hazards further reduce food availability and local production .	1
humanitarian assistance contributed to reducing the number of people in the emergency ( phase 4 ) in 2014 , according to the integrated food security phase classification ( ipc ) .	1
the deteriorating economy , combined with depleting household food stocks , high food prices and long-term effects of the conflict on livelihoods , is likely to further affect urban and rural populations .	0
particular efforts are made to enable the consultation and participation of vulnerable groups as well as understanding communities ’ preferences on safe and accessible channels for communicating complaints and feedback .	0
these new shocks have further reduced access to food for poor and displaced households , many of which were already unable to meet basic survival needs , even with extreme coping mechanisms .	1
consultations enable wfp to understand the specific needs , protection risks and selfprotection strategies of affected communities in the context of food assistance programming .	1
emergency school feeding ( esf ) will aim to provide stability , structure and routines that helps children to cope 5 6 approximately 41 percent of those projected to be in phase 3 – crisis .	1
investments in staff wellness also increase the attractiveness of south sudan as a duty station .	1
while physical accessibility has always been challenging in south sudan , the security situation , particularly in the dry season , does not allow the use of traditional roads in the three conflict affected states .	1
however , many organizations were forced to suspend operations or retract their presence from rural locations as security deteriorated .	0
cash-based transfers have however other benefits as they facilitate dietary diversity and dignity and they stimulate local economies .	1
intercommunal fighting , including cattle raids , has caused peaks in tensions , displacement and deaths in areas of jonglei , lakes and western equatoria .	1
approximately one in every three south sudanese have been forced to flee their homes and are either internally displaced or have sought refuge in neighbouring countries .	0

further , the need to respond to immediate lifethreatening emergencies has reduced capacity to address other protection concerns such as those of street children , incarcerated or exploited children , and women and girls exposed to harmful traditional practices , as well as housing , land and property concerns that hinder durable solutions for displaced persons .	1
given poor reach and quality of services and reporting , health partners have warned that many more are likely to be infected , and environmental change favouring the proliferation of sand-flies that spread the disease has escalated the problem .	0
continued economic decline has undermined people ’ s access to basic resources .	1
the conflict has also disrupted natural resource based livelihoods and the cereal deficit of 500,000 metric tons in 2017 is expected to be worse in 2018 , especially with the conflict expanding into the greater equatoria region – the country ’ s former ‘ bread basket ’ .	1
attacks on aid workers and destruction and looting of assets have forced hundreds of aid workers to relocate , disrupting services to affected people .	1
however , the expansion and intensification of the conflict at different times and in different locations in the country continue to cause people to seek refuge in recognized sites as well as in other camp-like settings where perception of safety is gained by living together .	1
the bsfp will be linked to the provision of gfd to allow for wider coverage and to meet the additional nutrient needs of vulnerable groups , therefore preventing them from becoming acutely malnourished .	1
assessments will include an analysis of potential gender based violence and protection risks linked to in-kind and cash-based transfers .	1
the country office has rolled out comet , the corporate monitoring database which links outcome and output results together with planning figures .	0
prices of other important food staples followed similar patterns , with wheat and cassava prices increasing by 45-56 percent between february and april and prices of groundnuts more than doubling over the same period .	0
the foreseen deterioration can be attributed to a number of factors : these include continuing economic crisis compounded by spiral price increases , continued inflation , poor harvests and early depletion of household stocks , continued population displacements resulting from localized conflict , trade flows hampered by insecurity , disruption of livelihood activities , and impeded investments and , therefore , revenue generation .	1

wfp is mitigating this through a multi-tiered access strategy : i ) continuing to work closely with the government , cooperating partners and ocha to ensure access to beneficiaries through advocacy , sensitization and other measures ; ii ) strengthening the capacity of its office and partners to expand large-scale mobile operations ; and iii ) mitigating access constraints caused by poor transport infrastructure through prepositioning , use of airdrops , and river transport where feasible and appropriate .	1
the concurrent protracted relief and recovery operation ( prro ) 200572 focuses on relief and recovery activities in the non-conflict affected states , and provides assistance to refugees and those displaced from abyei3.the co-existence and complementarity of the two operations stems from the need to address protracted refugee needs and protect and expand the marginal gains that have been made in addressing the underlying causes of food insecurity and malnutrition in less conflict affected areas in recent years , while the emop will focus largely on the lifesaving humanitarian needs caused directly by the conflict .	1
humanitarian needs and drivers the conflict and increasing levels of food insecurity worsened by rising staple food prices and collapse of the market , have had the most direct impact on people ’ s nutrition status .	1

the parallel exchange rate has been quite stable moving within a band between ssp 3.9 and 5.1 per usd up to the end of 2014 , when the shortage of foreign-exchange ( due to shrinking oil revenues caused by reduced domestic oil production in conflict-affected areas as well as record low international oil prices ) severely limited the ability of the boss to defend the value of the local currency .	1
although some sorghum is expected to be traded across the border in the sudan , some amounts are likely to be marketed internally , depending on security conditions , transportation costs compounded by local “ taxes ” imposed on traders moving grains to major markets and fluctuation of exchange rates between currencies in the sudan and south sudan .	1

poverty and food insecurity will likely continue to grow in urban areas and will be further worsened by insecurity , economic deterioration and disruption of livelihoods , increasing needs throughout the country .	1
trends of white sorghum price in juba , ( ssp / malua ) as the country is dependent on import for staple foods , the prices of food commodities are driven mainly by the deprecation of the local currency , high transport costs , high fuel prices , sporadic disruptions to the supply system and disrupted agricultural activities in the equatoria states , the traditional food basket of the country .	1
however , nationwide , the food insecure caseload ( ipc phases 3 , 4 and 5 ) increased from about 5 million in february to a record high of 6 million in june as food access continues to be severely constrained by widespread insecurity , large scale displacements , high food prices , market disruptions , macro-economic collapse and exhaustion of households ’ coping mechanisms .	1
it is assumed assistance will continue at similar levels as observed in 2017 , though it is also recognized that – following past trends - assistance will likely reach only half of the population in need and will be regularly disrupted by conflict in various areas .	1

this will continue to disrupt services to affected people .	0
meanwhile , macroeconomic factors continue to drive exorbitant staple food prices .	1
however , some households did not plant and conflict continues to limit food security improvements even during the harvest .	1
however , catastrophe ( ipc phase 5 ) remains possible in many other areas , specifically in the event that conflict restricts household movement in search of alternative food sources .	0
globally , current levels of ozone pollution are estimated to have suppressed maize , wheat , and soybean yields by 6 – 9 % ( 6 ) .	1

impunity reigns with no accountability mechanism in place to help end the violence .	0
however , persistently well above-average rainfall over thewestern ethiopia highlands could result in flooding during the coming weeks .	1
the lack of wash investment in urban areas has resulted in a worsening public health crisis leading to yearly occurrences of cholera outbreaks .	1
further escalation of the conflict would likely result in increased food insecurity and displacement while humanitarian access and space may become further restricted .	1
a recent report found that the clashes in upper nile in 2017 forcibly displaced tens of thousands of people , while armed forces and allied militia were responsible for deliberate killings , indiscriminate attacks and systematic looting.5 insecurity along key routes and attacks on road convoys have resulted in the killing of civilians .	1
economic desperation has resulted in more families seeking to ease hardships with dowry payments from forced and child marriages .	1
these limitations in accessing food , in combination with the impacts of four years on conflict on the nutritional and health status of many households in the country , would likely result in extreme food gaps , high levels of acute malnutrition , and significant excess mortality .	1
under the higher emission scenario , known as rcp8.5 , co2 concentrations would reach 940 ppm by 2100 and result in land warming of 4.0 – 6.8 ◦ c ( 7.2 – 12.2 ◦ f ) ( 75 , 115 ) .	1
given the low elasticity of demand for grains , the increase in market demand from farmers and herders will result in a rapid escalation in prices .	1
this has resulted in disruptions to livelihoods , markets , and access to humanitarian assistance .	1

how the direct effect of climate change on human capability will manifest in terms of changes in agricultural practices and overall production is still unclear , but there exists the concerning prospect of substantial and disproportionate impacts in the tropics on account of higher baseline heat stress , physical labor playing a more central role in productivity , and lower potential for adaptation .	0
although the net effect of climate change on pollinators remains uncertain , studies indicate that a reduction in animal pollination would decrease yields of numerous pollinator-dependent food crops that play important roles in providing food and micronutrients to humans ( 32 , 47 ) .	0
the effectiveness of this option depends on crop response to fertiliser use and the relative costs of purchase , transport and application of fertiliser .	0
ultimately , the gains from the price stabilizing effects of private rice imports outweighed the massive 2 million tons of food aid inflows ( del ninno , dorosh , and smith 2003 ) .	0
as a result , transport and marketing costs are high , significantly increasing the total cost of imports and reducing the prospect for exports .	1
last december , fao warned of a “ silent emergency ” as the ongoing conflict and instability undermined the livelihoods of the country ’ s agropastoral communities .	1
the main drivers of vulnerabilities related to wash are closely linked to the conflict .	1
high malnutrition rates are also strongly linked to poor wash conditions , as exemplified in the diarrhea-malnutrition cycle which is prevalent in vulnerable populations .	1

impacts of multiple crises economic need is also linked to increased criminality in many areas , including the equatorias , where civilians — including humanitarian workers — are increasingly being affected by theft , looting and related violent attacks .	1
however , conflict situations began to develop in other areas , in particular western equatoria and parts of eastern equatoria , which may not necessarily be linked to the original conflict .	0
historical background and overview of the agricultural economy of south sudan historical background south sudan ’ s food security issues are linked to its troubled history of two civil wars that raged for more than three decades .	1
the conflicts are mainly linked to cattle raiding among the pokot tribe in kenya and the karamojong in uganda .	1
high malnutrition rates are also strongly linked to poor wash conditions .	1

september 2017 the number of south sudanese refugees passes the 2 million mark , 1 million are in uganda alone , as insecurity continues in the equatorias .	0
exposure to damaging temperatures will generally increase as global temperatures rise ( 60 ) , although these trends will vary regionally and can be locally tempered by irrigation or other changes in agricultural practices ( 20 , 40 , 106 ) .	1
this is seen in the case of pastoralists who face rising grain prices but failing livestock prices as drought intensifies .	1
in periods of drought , as herd productivity falls , herders come to rely even more heavily on grain for their food needs .	0
for example , under the extensive farming practices of central mali , where the area per worker can be as high as 3-5 ha ., plough teams play a major role in achieving high yields of millet per worker , as they permit a very large area of land to be sown and weeded within a rainy season lasting only 6 to 8 weeks ( toulmin , 1983 ) .	0
“ trade worsened during the conflict as there was no exchange of goods from sudan and the other states of south sudan , ” he added .	1
however , as the soils in awerial county have high clay content and as cereals planted are predominantly the late-maturing sorghum landrace ( kec ) that - 62 withstands such fluctuations , crop development slowed but picked up as the rains returned to average levels during alternate dekads in september and to above average levels into november .	1
as almost all agricultural production is rain-fed , rainfall variability in terms of quantity and distribution is usually the major factor in determining crop performance .	0
although oil production may even slightly increase as the peace process progresses , the sharp decline in international oil prices during the second semester of 2015 and early 2016 makes the estimate of 2015/16 net oil revenues well too optimistic and a significant downward revision is likely to be needed .	1
as already high temperatures rise , the environment becomes less hospitable to plants .	0
note that as distribution requirements increase , calculated minimum stock levels would increase accordingly .	1
as the system expands , additional warehouses may need to be constructed or rented .	0
throughout 2015 , direct interventions by fao have been critical in keeping animals alive and productive as many partners fled highly insecure areas and access constraints persisted .	0

this expert report recognizes that addressing the root causes of humanitarian needs is the best way to shrink them and argues that as development is the best resilience-builder of all , funds for that should go where they matter most – situations of fragility – and that funds dedicated for peacebuilding and conflict resolution at the international level should be harnessed to systematic investment in resilience-building .	0
this commitment probably became possible as the conflict subsided , and helped to sustain more peaceful conditions .	1

food security has not improved significantly in october in central and southern unity as conflict continues to disrupt normal livelihood activities .	1
between february and may , food security will further deteriorate as households will have depleted their harvests and natural sources of food further decline .	1
between february and may , food security will deteriorate even further as households deplete their food stocks and are unable to purchase sufficient food at extremely high prices .	1
as climate change increases spatial and temporal variability in food production patterns , prices may also fluctuate more greatly .	1
an estimated 100,000 people face starvation in south sudan , where crop production has plummeted since 2013 as the conflict has killed tens of thousands and forced 3.5 million people farmers in morobo county planting groundnuts from their homes .	0
the richest members of the community may even be in a position to benefit during drought , as they can acquire land and other assets at low prices from distress sales by poorer neighbours .	0
even then , farmers may still consider the use of fertiliser in poor seasons as involving too high a risk .	0
in times of drought , this migration flow becomes especially important , as it both reduces the number of people to be fed from village granaries and provides a supplementary income for buying food .	1
low agricultural productivity can also be man­made as when poor advice on improved farming methods is given farmers .	0
in a worst-case scenario where conflict intensifies and humanitarian access is further limited , famine ( ipc phase 5 ) , marked by high levels of excess mortality , is possible .	1
economic crisis , marked by drastic hyperinflation and market failures , has further destabilised food systems and household access to food and income .	1
this is occurring at a time when import requirements are higher than usual given below-average harvests .	1
assumptions the october 2017 to may 2018 most likely scenario is based on the following national-level assumptions :  despite efforts to revitalize the agreement on the resolution of the conflict in the republic of south sudan ( arcss ) , and the arrival of the first-batch of the regional protection force ( rpf ) in the capital , intermittent clashes between government forces and armed opposition groups are likely to continue given past trends that armed clashes continue even as peace negotiations are were being held .	0
in leer , available evidence from the recent fsnms data conducted during the lean season july / august suggests some households were in catastrophe ( ipc phase 5 ) at the peak of the lean season , and given the likelihood that not all households have access to a harvest , it is expected that some households could still be in catastrophe ( ipc phase 5 ) .	0
areas of greatest concern include wau , northwestern jonglei , and central unity , though given the severity of food insecurity across south sudan and unpredictable nature of conflict , the possibility of famine ( ipc phase 5 ) should be considered in many states of the country .	0
) will persist given planned large-scale assistance and the likelihood of consistent delivery .	1
these food sources will also seasonally decline during this time , and given the expectation that macroeconomic conditions will also further deteriorate , food security outcomes are expected to be more extreme than during the 2017 lean season .	0
 market and trade route functioning is expected to continue at very low levels given insecurity .	0
although humanitarian assistance will likely reach at least some beneficiaries in these three counties through december , famine early warning systems network 12 south sudan food security outlook assistance deliveries cannot be guaranteed given ongoing insecurity .	1
high levels of gam and excess mortality already persist during the harvest , and given the expectation of continued very lower purchasing power and conflict-related restrictions to normal livelihood activities , many households are expected to face extreme acute food insecurity .	0
however , given the volatile nature of the conflict , assistance cannot be assumed throughout the outlook period .	0
labor in temperate regions is expected to be affected less by warming , but an economic assessment found that us labor productivity in agricultural and other sectors involving intense outdoor activity would still decline by 0.6 – 3.2 % by the end of the century , given a high-emissions scenario ( 68 ) .	0
another study indicates that the biomass of tropical fish communities will also be smaller by about 20 % in 2050 , given a high-emission scenario , on account of ocean warming and associated reductions in oxygen content ( 36 ) .	1
however , very few of these loans seem to have been subsequently repaid , given continuing drought in some areas and the political uncertainty following land reform .	1
the costs of such schemes are likely to be substantial , given the high foreign exchange cost of purchasing the tractors , and of the spare parts and fuel which will be needed for their operation .	1
a strong case can be made for priority to be given to crop production , given the importance of grain in the diets of all consumers and of the poorest groups in particular .	0
government attempts to manipulate livestock prices , in order to help farmers purchase new work oxen ( i.e. at lower prices ) , may also be of limited value given the large proportion of domestic and external trade which passes through unofficial channels in many countries .	0
5.5 food expenditure : recent patterns and at-harvest situation households in south sudan spend a large proportion of their incomes on food , given the high degree to which they depend on markets for their staple food supply and the high food prices of the recent past .	1
in the worst case scenario , given the severity of the food security and nutrition situation observed during the 2017 lean season , continued conflict , humanitarian access constraints , climatic shocks and macro-economic instability leading up to the 2018 lean season will likely result in famine ( ipc phase 5 ) conditions in multiple locations across south sudan .	0
