In the capital, Juba, prices of maize and sorghum more than
doubled in the first semester of 2017, reaching record levels in
June, driven by a tight supply situation, market disruptions,
hyperinflation and a significant depreciation of the local currency.
Subsequently, they declined by about 12 percent between June
and August, following the first season harvest in southern bimodal
rainfall areas and the establishment, by the Government,
of a trading company selling basic food commodities at
subsidized prices. Prices of groundnuts decreased by 22 percent
over the same period, while prices of wheat flour continued to
soar in recent months, reaching new record highs in August.
Overall, prices of these food staples in August were more than
twice the high levels in August last year and up to 12 times higher
than in the corresponding period two years earlier.
