Key messages
 ↗ International  prices  of  maize  and  wheat  generally  increased  in 
October.  Maize  prices  were  underpinned  by  further  downward 
revisions  of  the  2015  production  forecasts  in  key  exporting 
countries, while lingering concerns about inadequate precipitation 
for planting of the 2016 winter wheat crop in the Black Sea Region 
and in the United States of America supported wheat prices. The 
FAO Rice price Index remained under pressure driven by declines in 
Aromatic and Japonica rice segments.

 ↗ In Southern Africa, prices of maize continued to increase in October, 
reaching levels well above those of a year earlier, particularly in 
South Africa and Malawi, reflecting tight market supplies due to a 
sharp subregional production decline this year. 

 ↗ In  Central  America,  prices  of  white  maize  decreased  sharply  in 
October with the completion of the 2015 main season harvests and 
imports improving supplies. Prices, however, remained above their 
year-earlier levels in most countries supported by the reduced first 
season outputs and concerns about second season harvest prospects.
 ↗ Weak  national  currencies  continued  to  put  upward  pressure  on 
domestic cereal prices in countries of the CIS and South America, 
with largest depreciations recorded in Kazakhstan and Brazil over 
the past few months.

International prices of maize and wheat generally increased in October, those 
of rice remained under downward pressure
Export prices of maize from the united States of america, the world’s 
largest maize producer and exporter, increased for the second consecutive 
month in october. the international benchmark uS maize (no.2, Yellow) 
price averaged  uSD 172 per tonne, nearly 4 percent higher than in 
September and 4.5 percent up from the corresponding period last year. the 
increase follows further downward revisions of 2015 production forecasts 
in key exporting countries, notably ukraine. Stronger wheat quotations 
also provided some support. However, seasonal downward pressure with 
the bulk of the 2015 harvest nearing completion and sluggish exports 
limited the increase. In South america, maize export prices in october 
were supported by strong export demand, while in the Black Sea region 
quotations declined on seasonal harvest pressure.   

weather conditions affecting winter wheat plantings in ukraine, the 
russian federation and in some areas of the united States of america 
continued to underpin prices. overall, however, ample global supplies and 
strong export competition continued to weigh on prices.

the fao Rice Price Index dropped again in october, shedding 7 points, 
or 3.3 percent, from September. the decrease was mainly driven by the 
aromatic and Japonica rice, which saw their respective price sub-indices 
retrenching by 8 percent and 5 percent, respectively. on the other hand, 
the lower Quality Indica rice sub-index was substantially unchanged, while 
that of Higher Quality Indica prices rebounded by 1 percent. the white rice 
benchmark quotation (thai 100%B) was among those firming, increasing 
by almost 3 percent to uSD 376 per tonne in october. Most quotations were 
up in thailand, but also in Viet nam, reflecting anticipated or confirmed new 
sales to Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia. By contrast, export prices 
in India and Pakistan remained under pressure on limited buying interest 
pending the arrival of new harvested crops. Prices in South america were 
stable to lower, as competition among exporters remained stiff.

Export  prices  of  wheat  increased  further  in  october,  with  the 
benchmark uS wheat (no.2 Hard red Winter) price averaging uSD 218 
per tonne, up 1 percent from September but still more than 20 percent 
lower than its year-earlier value. Despite some beneficial precipitation 
in the second half of the month, lingering concerns about overall dry

Prices of beans at near-record levels
retail prices of red and black beans declined marginally in october, but 
lingered well above their levels at the same time last year, by about 40 percent. 
Despite flows of imports, prices were supported by an anticipated decline in this 
year’s production due to severe dry weather, which follows last year’s already 
drought-reduced output.

Prices of maize still relatively high 
Wholesale prices of white maize were relatively stable in october but above 
their levels a year earlier due to the reduced first season output and concerns 
about the second season harvest, which will begin from late november, as 
a result of the severe dry weather associated with the El niño phenomenon 
during the planting period.

Rice prices at record levels
Prices of medium quality rice strengthened further to record highs in october, 
reflecting reduced levels of stocks and lower ongoing 2015 off-season harvests. 
Some support was also provided by concerns over the slow planting progress 
of the 2016 main season crop due to dry weather associated with the El niño 
phenomenon.  In  an  attempt  to  stabilize  prices,  the  Government  started 
to distribute, on 2 october, 300 000 tonnes of subsidized rice through the 
raskin (rice-for-the-poor) programme. official reports also indicate that the 
Government is likely to import rice in the forthcoming months to improve 
domestic supplies and stabilize prices.

Maize prices rose further in October
Maize prices continued to rise significantly in october, having increased at 
a steady rate since May. the national average price of maize in october was 
more than 90 percent above its year-earlier value and only 4 percent below 
the record level of January last year. the steep rise in prices is a result of the 
sharply reduced maize production this year due to an extended dry period in 
the first quarter of 2015. Despite an increase in import volumes in an attempt 
to stabilize domestic supplies, the agricultural Development and Marketing 
corporation (aDMarc) rationed maize sales to only 20 kg per person and 
increased the subsidized retail prices of maize by about 37 percent providing 
further support to prices.

6 percent decline in october with the beginning of the 2015 main season 
harvest,  prices  remained  well  above  their  year-earlier  levels  due  to  an 
anticipated  reduction  in  the  current  season  output  following  crop  losses 
after severe floods in July and early august. resumption of rice exports in 
mid-September, following a suspension at the beginning of august to stabilize 
prices, provided further upward pressure on prices. Earlier in the year, strong 
import demand, supported by the currency weakness, had pushed prices up.

White maize prices still above their year-earlier levels despite sharp 
declines
White maize prices declined sharply in october halting the increasing trend 
of the previous months. Prices were pressured by the bulk of the 2015 main 
season harvest entering the market. Prices, however, remained well above their 
levels a year earlier supported by the reduced first season output and concerns 
about the second season harvest which will begin from late november as a 
result of the severe dry weather associated with the El niño phenomenon 
during the planting period.

Maize prices lingered at high levels in October
Maize price increases slowed somewhat in october, rising by just 1 percent, 
although quotations were still well above their year-earlier values and close 
to import parity levels. the high price levels are largely being driven by the 
reduced 2015 production, while a weaker currency also supported the overall 
increasing trend. a subdued production outlook for the 2016 crop reflecting 
expected lower plantings and an unfavourable rainfall forecast due to the 
prevailing El niño phenomenon provided further upward pressure. 

Prices of wheat flour at high levels despite recent declines
the recently-completed good 2015 wheat harvest continued to weigh on prices 
of wheat flour, which showed some declines in october. However, the country 
depends on imports to satisfy its consumption requirements, particularly from 
Kazakhstan, and the sharp depreciation of the national currency over the past 
year made costs of food imports more expensive and prevented prices of flour 
from declining further. as a result, prices in october remained some 20 percent 
higher than at the same time last year and at near-record levels in several 
markets.

Maize prices continued to increase in october, after surging in September, and

from Kenya, South Sudan, the Democratic republic of congo (Drc), rwanda 
and Burundi has underpinned prices in the past months. Prices in october, 
however, rose at a slower rate than in the past month as a result of a recent 
decline in export demand from Kenya, where the harvest is currently underway. 
Increased fuel costs and concerns about the second season harvest, to be 
gathered from December, due to below-average rainfall over the past couple 
of months, exacerbated seasonal price increases.

improved market supplies. However, prices remained more than double their

to late and erratic rains in most growing areas coupled with sustained import

Coarse grain prices continued to show mixed trends in coastal countries, but 
remained generally stable in the sahel  
In coastal countries along the Gulf of Guinea, harvesting of the 2015 
first season crops has put significant downward pressure on prices in 
some countries, particularly in Nigeria, where millet prices dropped 
by 15 percent between July and September. By contrast, in Benin 
and Togo, although maize prices were mostly stable or declined 
in September, they remained well above their year-earlier levels 
following the steep upward trend over the previous few months. 
In Malanville (Benin) and anie (togo), maize prices in September 
were, respectively, 91 percent and 128 percent higher than a year 

earlier. the upward price pressure was largely a result of uncertain 
prospects for food supplies in the current season, due to irregular 
rainfall, which could negatively impact growing crops. In the Sahel 
belt, coarse grain prices remained mostly unchanged in october in 
Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali after declining in previous months. 
Similarly,  in  Chad,  coarse  grain  prices  have  stabilized  in  recent 
months in most parts of the country, with the exception of Moussoro 
and n’Djamena, where significant increases in millet and sorghum 
prices were observed.

maize prices continue to rise supported by tight supplies
In Southern africa, the tight maize supply situation continued to 
exert upward price pressure, while an uncertain production outlook 
for  the  2016  cereal  crop,  currently  being  planted,  and  weaker 
currencies in some countries, also contributed to the firming up of 
prices. In South Africa, the sharp increase of maize prices in the 
past months slowed somewhat in october, rising by just 1 percent, 
although quotations were still well above their year-earlier values 
and close to import parity levels. the high price levels are largely 
being  driven  by  the  reduced  2015  production,  while  a  weaker 
currency also supported the overall increasing trend. a subdued 
production outlook for the 2016 crop, reflecting lower expected 
plantings and an unfavourable rainfall forecast due to the prevailing 

El niño phenomenon, provided further upward pressure. In Malawi, 
steep price gains persisted in october mostly reflecting the sharp 
contraction in the 2015 output and prices were almost double their 
year-earlier levels. In Zambia, despite a reduced harvest, ample 
supplies  contributed  to  delaying  seasonal  price  increases  this 
year. However, large volumes of exports, supported by a weaker 
national currency and large institutional purchases by the food 
reserve agency (completed in october), led to a sharp price rise 
in october. In import-dependent Lesotho and Swaziland, while 
maize meal prices were stable in September they remained up on 
their year-earlier levels reflecting higher South african prices and 
lower domestic outputs.

Cereal  prices  followed  mixed  trends  in  October  and  at  high  levels  in  some 
countries
Prices of locally-produced cereals followed mixed trends in october. 
Maize prices rose further or remained firm and at levels well above 
those  of  a  year  earlier  in  uganda  and  the  united  republic  of 
tanzania due to sustained regional demand and reduced harvests 
this year, while they declined elsewhere with the beginning of the 
2015 main season harvests. In Uganda, maize prices continued to 
increase seasonally in october and were well above their levels a 
year earlier. the high prices mainly reflect strong regional demand 
from neighbouring countries. concerns about the outlook for the 
second  season  harvest,  to  be  gathered  from  December,  due  to 
below-average rainfall over the past couple of months, provided 
additional support. Prices in october, however, rose at a slower 
rate than in September, as a result of a decline in export demand 
from Kenya, where harvesting is currently underway. In the United 
Republic of Tanzania, prices of maize remained relatively stable 
in october, following the release of grain from the national food 
reserve agency (nfra) which improved market supplies. However, 
prices  were  more  than  double  their  levels  in  october  last  year 
due to a reduced 2015 cereal production, coupled with sustained 
import demand from neighbouring countries in the past months. In 
the Sudan, prices of locally-produced sorghum and millet, the main 
staples, levelled off or declined in october after the increases of the 

past few months, as recent rains slightly improved 2015 cereal crop 
prospects and traders released stocks ahead of the 2015 harvest 
in november. coarse grain prices in october were well below their 
year-earlier levels due to ample availabilities from last year’s bumper 
harvest. In the capital, Khartoum, prices of wheat, mostly imported 
and consumed in urban areas, rose in october but remained below 
the  levels  of  the  same  month  last  year.  In Kenya,  maize  prices 
continued to decline in october in several markets with the progress 
of the long-rains main season harvest in key-growing areas of the 
rift Valley and the release of stocks from the strategic grain reserve 
of the national cereals and Produce Board (ncPB) agency. Prices 
in october were at about the same levels as a year earlier or lower, 
except in the capital, nairobi, where they were about 30 percent 
higher due to sustained local demand. In Ethiopia, maize prices 
generally declined in october with the beginning of the 2015 meher 
main season harvest. Prices were below their year-earlier levels, 
despite  the  reduced  2015 belg  secondary  harvest  completed  in 
august, due to ample availabilities from the above-average 2014 
cereal production. In Somalia, prices of locally-produced maize and 
sorghum showed mixed trends in october, but remained below their 
year-earlier in most markets due to the 2015 gu and gu off-season 
harvests, which continued to enter the markets in october.

Food Price Monitoring and Analysis10 November 2015easT asIa

Domestic rice and wheat prices stable or slightly on the increase and mostly 
at low levels
Domestic rice prices remained overall stable or increased in some 
countries in october and were in general below their year-earlier 
levels. concerns about weather-related 2015 main season crop losses, 
currently being harvested, limited seasonal declines or pushed up 
prices. In main exporters, Viet Nam and Thailand, anticipated and 
committed  large  purchases  from  key  regional  importers,  namely 
Indonesia and the Philippines, provided further support. In Cambodia, 
rice prices remained stable or increased in some markets supported 
by export demand and an expected decrease in the 2015 main season 
output, following the prolonged dry weather in the first part of the 
season. In India, prices remained unchanged in most markets with 
the downward pressure from the ongoing 2015 main kharif season 
harvest  offset  by  the  recently-started  government  purchases  at 
prices, 4 percent higher than in the previous season. By contrast, in 
Myanmar, rice prices declined after the sustained increase of the past 
few months, with the beginning of the 2015 main season harvest. 
Prices, however, remained well above their year-earlier levels, due 
to an anticipated reduction in the current season output following 
crop losses after severe floods in July and early august. In China, 
retail prices of Japonica rice were unchanged in october and slightly 

higher than a year earlier. In the Philippines, rice quotations eased 
somewhat in recent weeks, with the progress of the 2015 main season 
harvest and large imported volumes in the previous months. However, 
downward price pressure was limited by the overall tight supply 
outlook in view of a reduction in this season’s output. rice prices 
increased further to record highs in Indonesia, reflecting reduced 
levels of stocks and lower 2015 off-season production. concerns over 
the slow planting progress of the 2016 main season crop, due to 
dry weather, associated with the El niño phenomenon, also provided 
support. Some strengthening in prices was reported in Bangladesh 
and Sri Lanka, although quotations remained well below their year-
earlier levels, mainly reflecting adequate supplies from the 2015 good 
harvests. retail prices of wheat and wheat flour remained unchanged 
in most countries of the subregion. However, in Pakistan, wheat flour 
prices rose due to the increasing cost of locally-produced wheat. In 
Afghanistan, wheat grain quotations showed seasonal trends in 
october with stronger increases in areas more dependent on imports, 
reflecting a weak local currency. overall, however, prices were lower 
than a year earlier in most countries, mainly as a result of good 
availabilities from the 2015 harvests and adequate imports.

Food Price Monitoring and Analysis10 November 2015CIs - asIa aND eUROPe

Wheat flour prices weaken further in importing countries but still high
In  importing  countries  of  the  subregion,  prices  of  wheat  flour 
weakened further in october, but only moderately, despite the recently-
completed good 2015 wheat harvests and the decline of export prices 
of milling wheat in Kazakhstan, the main supplier in the subregion. 
In Tajikistan, prices of wheat flour declined somewhat in october 
with the availability of new supplies from the 2015 wheat harvest 
but  the  continuing  depreciation  of  the  national  currency  limited 
downward pressure as the country depends highly on imports to meet 
its consumption needs and prices remained some 20 percent above 
their levels in october last year. Similarly, in Kyrgyzstan, despite the 
good 2015 wheat harvest, prices of wheat flour eased only slightly in 
some markets or remained unchanged and significantly higher than a 
year earlier mainly reflecting the weak national currency. In Georgia, 
which  also  heavily  depends  on  wheat  imports,  average  prices  of 
wheat flour eased further in october, reflecting lower year-on-year 

prices from the russian federation, the country’s main supplier. In 
exporting countries of the subregion, domestic and export prices 
of wheat increased on concerns about early prospects for the 2016 
wheat crop following unfavourable weather conditions during the 
planting season. In Ukraine, an increase in export demand supported 
by the recent further devaluation of the Hryvnia added to the upward 
pressure. In the Russian Federation, additional support to prices was 
provided by the recent increase of intervention prices for the 2015 
wheat crop (fPMa food Policies). However, in these countries, while 
domestic prices of wheat and wheat flour were more than one-third 
above their levels in october last year, export quotations were nearly 
20 percent lower. In Kazakhstan, export prices of wheat decreased 
further in october and were lower year-on-year as a result of improved 
supplies from the recently-completed harvest, which is estimated to 
have recovered from the reduced level of 2014.

Food Price Monitoring and Analysis10 November 2015CeNTRaL ameRICa aND  THe CaRIbbeaN

maize and bean prices decreased sharply in October
Wholesale  prices  of  white  maize  generally  decreased  sharply  in 
october with the conclusion of the 2015 main season harvests and 
flows of supplies from Mexico, the subregion’s main producer, as well 
as imports from the united States of america into the other countries. 
Prices, however, remained well above their levels a year earlier in 
most countries of the subregion supported by the reduced first season 
outputs and concerns about the second season harvests which will 
begin from late november, as a result of the severe dry weather 
associated with the El niño phenomenon during the planting period. 
the sharpest decline in maize prices was observed in Nicaragua, 
which also led to a decline in prices of tortillas, the basic food. Strong 
price declines were also reported in Honduras. In both countries, 
however, prices remained more than 10 percent above their levels a 
year earlier. In Guatemala, white maize prices declined by 7 percent 
in october and were slightly lower than at the same time last year, 
mainly reflecting increased imports from Mexico. In El Salvador, 
prices  remained  relatively  unchanged  and  above  their  levels  in 
october last year. In Mexico, prices remained stable in october but 
above their year-earlier values despite a bumper harvest, mostly due 
to a weak local currency.

Bean  prices  in  the  subregion  declined  sharply  in  october 
reflecting  recent  imports  and  the  conclusions  of  the  2015  first 
season  harvests.  In  El  Salvador,  Honduras  and  Nicaragua, 
prices declined by some 10 percent or more in october and were 
well below their values a year earlier. In Guatemala, where black 
bean is the variety mostly produced and consumed, prices eased 
slightly  in october  and  were  lower  than  at  the  same  time  last 
year. In the Dominican Republic, retail prices of red and black 
beans  declined  marginally  in october,  but  lingered  well  above 
their levels the corresponding time last year. Despite the flow of 
imports, prices were supported by an anticipated decline in this 
year’s production due to severe dry weather, which follows last 
year’s already drought-reduced output. 

In  Haiti,  prices  of  main  staple  imported  rice  generally 
strengthened in october, supported by a recent increase in export 
prices from the united States of america, the country’s main supplier. 
Maize meal prices were overall unchanged but well above their 
year-earlier levels, as a result of unfavourable prospects for this 
year’s production due to prolonged dry weather associated with 
the El niño phenomenon.

Food Price Monitoring and Analysis10 November 2015sOUTH ameRICa

Wheat flour followed mixed trends in October, those of yellow maize generally 
on the increase
Domestic prices of wheat and wheat flour followed mixed trends in 
october but remained, in general, below or around their year-earlier 
levels reflecting adequate availabilities from last year’s good harvests. In 
Argentina and Chile, prices continued to seasonally increase in october 
and weak local currencies provided further support. However, supplies 
from last year’s good outputs contributed to keep prices unchanged from 
a year earlier. In Bolivia, Brazil, Peru and Uruguay, prices of wheat 
flour declined in october and were below their year-earlier levels. ample 
carryover stocks, adequate levels of imports and relatively good prospects 
for the upcoming 2015 harvests contributed to the price declines. In 
Colombia, the weak local currency, despite a recent strengthening, 
continued to support prices despite the flow of imports. In Ecuador, 
wheat flour prices in october remained relatively unchanged from their 
level of the previous month and a year earlier reflecting adequate imports. 

Yellow maize prices increased in most countries of the subregion 
in october. In Argentina and Brazil, prices increased sharply and 
were well above their year-earlier levels despite bumper harvests 
this year and adequate carryover stocks. Prices were underpinned by 
a strong depreciation of the local currencies coupled with a robust 
export demand. In Bolivia, prices increased in the main market 
of  Santa cruz,  but  remained  well  below  their  levels  in october 
last year as a result of good supplies from the 2015 harvest and 
adequate import levels. Prices strengthened also in Ecuador and 
Chile, while they declined in Peru. overall, prices of yellow maize 
remained below their levels in october last year, with the exception 
of  Colombia,  which  heavily  depends  on  imports  to  satisfy  its 
consumption requirements, due to the depreciation of the national 
currency.
