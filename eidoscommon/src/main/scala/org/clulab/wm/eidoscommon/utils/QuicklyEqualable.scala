  /**
    * This is what subclasses should implement.  They should
    * normally check with the superclass first, so super.biEquals(other).
    * The top class should not consult this one, however, at least
    * not expecting true out of it.  false is here so that the
    * result is only true if triEquals has decided in equals below.
    * In the end one gets this.eq(other) by default.
    *
    * Note that biEquals should be called by equals after triEquals.
    * triEquals will have already checked with canEqual that other
    * has the same class as this.  In biEquals it is therefore possible
    * to blindly cast to the class of this, which should be faster than
    * matching.  Even though that's not the Scala way, for the sake of
    * efficiency of QuicklyEqualable, that's how it's just now implemented.
    *
    * For example,
    *
    * override def biEquals(other: Any): Boolean = {
    *   val that = other.asInstanceOf[ContextAttachmentSpec]
    *
    *   this.text == that.text
    * }
    *
    * is being favored over
    *
    * override def biEquals(other: Any): Boolean = other match {
    *   case that: ContextAttachmentSpec => this.text == that.text
    * }
