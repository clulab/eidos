South Sudan's principal trading partner is Uganda (Table 2.5). Customs officials believe that 80 percent of all goods imported into South Sudan enter through the Nimule-Torit-Juba route (WFP 2015). Trade with Sudan, South Sudan's second most important trading partner, has decreased significantly since independence. Trade between the two countries now is mainly informal. Most food from Sudan is transported from El Obeid to Aweil. Before the separation of the two countries, northern Sudan was a key provider of both food and fuel for southern Sudan. However, in 2012 the border was closed and supply was cut off (World Bank 2014). Since 2013 some borders have been reopened, but trade has been slow to recover. Kenya's trade with South Sudan is mainly in nonfood items. Ethiopia also trades with South Sudan, and in opposition-controlled areas, trade is now almost entirely with Ethiopia.

Although about 70 percent of total land area is suitable for cultivation in South Sudan, only 4 percent of the land is currently used for agriculture (Diao et al. 2011, Figure 2.1). Thus, there is ample scope for expansion of area cultivated. Currently, most crop cultivation is done on small farms, producing little if any marketable surplus. According to estimates for 2013 from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP), 10 percent of the population of South Sudan (about 1 million people) are severely food insecure (FAO and WFP 2013).

Rainfall within the country ranges from 500 mm to 2,000 mm per year, with the highest levels of rainfall in the southern part of the country. Much of north central and northeastern South Sudan is located in flood plains along the Nile River (the Sudd) that are flooded during the rainy season but receive little rainfall otherwise (600 to 800 mm per year). The highest potential areas for agricultural production are Western Equatoria and the southern half of Central Equatoria, or the so-called Green Belt, where annual rainfall ranges from 900 to 2,000 mm per year (Table 2.6). Rainfall in the Hills and Mountains region of the northern half of Central Equatoria and the western half of Eastern Equatoria (500 to 800 mm per year) is also sufficient to support substantial crop agriculture (WFP 2011).

In most areas of South Sudan, soils are low in phosphorous as well as in organic matter. Despite this, most soils are moderately fertile. But soils could quickly become nutrient deficient due to leaching related to heavy rainfall, low levels of fertilizer use (on average only 4 kg per ha of fertilizers are used in South Sudan), and over-farming. Nutrient mining from maize production ranges between 30 and 60 kg per ha per year. Smallholders have limited knowledge and capacity, lack an understanding of the role of fertilizer in improved crop production, and do not have access to extension or transfer services--all factors that could lead to further soil nutrient depletion (Kowr 2013).

Institutional weakness has further hindered development of the agriculture sector. Disagreements over land rights for crop cultivation and livestock grazing continue to be a major source of conflict. This insecurity discourages farmers from expanding production, and traders and retailers from building marketing infrastructure. The extremely low level of public investment in recent decades has meant that essentially no irrigation infrastructure exists and only 2 percent of South Sudan's limited road network is paved. Roads are poorly maintained, not repaired, and completely washed out during the rainy season (World Bank 2012; USAID and Fintrac 2012). Because of this inadequate transportation infrastructure, it is difficult and expensive for subsistence farmers to transport surpluses to markets.

Further, poor business practices and a lack of information about market prices make it difficult for businesses to develop along the agriculture value chain. South Sudan receives a ranking of 186 out of 189 on ease of doing business in the World Bank 2015 Doing Business report (World Bank 2014). Furthermore, South Sudan receives a percentile rank of 5.7 in government effectiveness and of 3.0 in control of corruption in the World Bank's governance indicators (World Bank 2015).

Up to 4.8 million people in South Sudan--well over one-third of the population--will be facing severe food shortages over the coming months, and the risk of a hunger catastrophe continues to threaten parts of the country, three UN agencies warned today.

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Food Programme (WFP) stressed that while the deteriorating situation coincides with an unusually long and harsh annual lean season, when families have depleted their food stocks and new harvests are not expected until August, the level of food insecurity this year is unprecedented.

According to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) update released today by the government, the three agencies and other humanitarian partners, 4.8 million people are projected to be in need of urgent food, agriculture and nutrition assistance through July, up from 4.3 million in April. This is the highest level of hunger since the conflict in South Sudan began two-and-a-half years ago. This number does not include 350,000 residents of the UN Protection of Civilians areas or other camps for displaced people, who currently are entirely dependent on humanitarian assistance.

"We are very worried to see that food insecurity is spreading beyond conflict areas as rising prices, impassable roads and dysfunctional markets are preventing many families, even those in towns and cities, from accessing food," said FAO Country Representative Serge Tissot.

Food insecurity and conflict are also forcing many families to leave South Sudan for neighbouring countries. In the last few months alone, an estimated 100,000 South Sudanese people have crossed into Sudan, Kenya, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda, and this number is expected to increase to more than 150,000 by the end of June.

"The levels of malnutrition among children continue to be truly alarming," said Mahimbo Mdoe, UNICEF's Representative in South Sudan. "Since the beginning of the year more than 100,000 children have been treated for severe malnutrition. That's a 40 per cent increase compared to the same period last year, and a 150 percent increase since 2014."

Working with a large number of international and local non-governmental organizations, FAO, UNICEF and WFP will continue to deliver life- and livelihood- saving support under these difficult circumstances.

"We are now seeing sharp spikes of need in new areas, such as Eastern Equatoria or Western Bahr el-Ghazal, where malnutrition rates in some places are reaching dangerous levels. We have started ramping up food and nutrition support, but much more is needed to keep things from deteriorating even further during the lean season," said WFP Country Director Joyce Luma.

In 2016, FAO is planning to provide emergency livelihood support to 3.1 million people in South Sudan. It is currently distributing over half a million crop and fishing kits and is assisting livestock production through the vaccination of some 11 million animals.

The dramatic rise in malnutrition rates, means that in the first four months of the year UNICEF has already treated 45 per cent of its planned 2016 caseload of 166,000 children. WFP plans to assist 3.3 million people in South Sudan this year through a combination of emergency food assistance, lifesaving nutrition support for mothers and young children, community-based asset-creation projects where possible, and safety net programmes such as school meals.


#3 Doc3_EA_Seasonal Monitor_2017_08_11 BG.pdf

Rainfall in July continued to be above average over areas of eastern Sudan, western Ethiopia, and northeastern South Sudan, which has been favorable for cropping activities. In addition, heavier than normal rainfall is increasing the risk of flooding in many of the flood-prone areas.

Rainfall deficits have accumulated over the past 30 days in Tigray and northern Afar Regions of Ethiopia. In Kenya, a late start to the season and extended dry spells have led to reduced crop yields and poorer than usual crop production prospects.

During the next two weeks, moderate to heavy seasonal rainfall is expected to continue over western Ethiopia and eastern Sudan lowlands, with heightened risk of flooding in these regions. Meanwhile, above-average rainfall is forecast over northern Ethiopia, which could help reduce recent rainfall deficits.

During the past month, rainfall was persistently heavy and well above average over eastern Sudan, western Ethiopia, and northeastern South Sudan, with positive anomalies of between 100 - 300 mm during this period. This has resulted in favorable agricultural conditions, but also the potential for flooding in flood prone regions of western and eastern lowlands of Sudan. Average to above-average rainfall has extended into Yemen, southern Eritrea, northern South Sudan, Uganda, and western Kenya (Figure 1). However, rainfall was below average in Afar and parts of Tigary regions of northern Ethiopia, as well as in parts of southwestern South Sudan and northern Uganda. The eastern Horn remained seasonally sunny and dry.

Vegetation conditions remain above average in many northern areas of East Africa, according to eMODIS/NDVI (Figure 2), likely as a result of ongoing above-average rainfall in Sudan, South Sudan, and parts of western and central Ethiopia, as well as eastern Tanzania. Meanwhile, vegetation conditions remain below average in much of the eastern Horn, western and central Tanzania, southern Uganda, and eastern Equatoria in South Sudan.

Satellite-derived estimates suggest water resources are continuing to decline at surface water points in the Mandera triangle, which include the predominantly pastoral areas of eastern and southern Ethiopia, northeastern Kenya, and southern Somalia. The current dry and abnormally hotter-than-normal land-surface-temperatures are expected to continue until the Deyr/Hageya/short rains season, which normally starts in October.

The following is a country-by-country update on recent seasonal progress to date:

In Ethiopia, the (June - September) seasonal rains are currently well established across the country, and during the month of July seasonal rains began on time in Afar and Tigray, though at below-average levels. Cropping conditions are generally favorable in most western areas and central areas due to good performance of seasonal rainfall since the start of the season. However, persistently well above-average rainfall over thewestern Ethiopia highlands could result in flooding during the coming weeks. These continued rains could also reduce the impact of Fall Armyworm, for which infestations have been reported in six regions of Ethiopia. Rainfall is forecast to be moderate to heavy in the coming weeks, which will likely contribute to the potential for flooding and help erase rainfall deficits in some northern areas.

Somalia remained seasonally sunny and dry, except in northern coastal areas of Somalia and areas bordering eastern Djibouti, where Karan/Xagaa seasonal rains were generally light and below average. Pasture and water resources have continued to decline in much of central and northern Somalia. However, southern regions of Somalia have benefited from localized coastal rains for the past month.

In Kenya, the shortened length of the main growing season, due in part to a delayed onset of seasonal rainfall, coupled with long dry spells and below-average rainfall is resulting in below-average production prospects in large parts of the eastern, central, and southern Rift Valley. Key agricultural production areas were also affected by an erratic onset of rainfall, prolonged dry spells in June, and FAW, especially in Uasin-Gishu and parts of Trans-Nzoia counties, where maize yields are expected to be particularly poor.

In Karamoja in Uganda, rainfall during the past month has been average to above average, an improvement over below-average rainfall received early in the rainy season. This, coupled with a continuation of above-average rainfall forecast in the coming weeks, is expected to improve crop production prospects and pasture conditions. In areas of northern Uganda, particularly West Nile Region where planting was significantly delayed by almost a month, late-planted crops are currently in good condition and in maturity stages of grain filling. Harvesting and drying of first season cereals and legumes is ongoing in most bi-modal areas of central, eastern, south and western Uganda. However, the forecast widespread rainfall during the next 1-2 weeks may delay harvesting and drying activities.

In Sudan, seasonal rainfall has continued to be above average during the past few weeks, which has been favorable in most cropping areas of the country. The weekly forecasts indicate continued intensification of seasonal rainfall, with increased likelihood for flooding in flood-prone areas of eastern Sudan. However, there are localized areas in western Darfur where July rains were below average, resulting in drier-than-normal vegetation conditions. In the coming weeks, the seasonal rains are expected to intensify and may help ease the current dry conditions in parts of western Darfur.

In South Sudan, rainfall in July has generally been average to above average across the country. Widespread rains have been favorable for crop development in Greater Bahr el Ghazal and Greater Upper Nile states. According to the latest field reports, there was a slight reduction in rainfall in July compared to the previous month, over Wau and Jur River in Western Bhar el Gazal, Gogrial East, Gogrial West, and Tonj East in Warrap, and Aweil Centre County in Northern Bhar el Gazal, but the decline in rainfall was not enough to result in moisture stress on crops. Meanwhile, in Greater Equatoria, favorable rainfall since the start of July has enabled agricultural households to begin sowing. In parts of Central Equatoria (Juba County), Eastern Equatoria (Magwi and Torit counties), Jonglei (Pibor and Pochalla counties), and Western Bahr el Ghazal (Wau County), FAO and the National Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security have confirmed significant infestations of Fall Armyworm.

In Yemen, second season (July to September) rainfall season started on time in July and has been above average across western, central, and parts of eastern Yemen. Vegetation conditions are currently below across many western coastal and mountainous areas of the country, with above-average vegetation conditions in parts of Ta'izz and Ibb governorates. Although, the short-and long-term rainfall forecasts are favorable for agricultural areas of the western and central highlands, production of most crops is likely to be limited due to insecurity and lack of availability and/or access to farm inputs due to ongoing conflict.

Moderate to heavy rainfall is expected to continue during the next two weeks across Sudan, South Suda, Uganda, northern Kenya, and western/northern Ethiopia (Figure 3). Persistent heavy rains in the Ethiopian highlands, eastern Sudan, and South Sudan, coupled with highly saturated soils in these areas, is likely to cause flooding in flood-prone areas, as is typical in August.

The expected intensification of seasonal rains over northern Uganda is expected to help gradually ease rainfall deficits that developed earlier in the season. In parts of western Kenya and central/eastern Uganda, the expected heavy rains may hamper ongoing maize harvesting and drying activities and could result in post-harvest losses, if the rains are sustained without significant dry days in coming weeks. Similarly for eastern and central Uganda, where crop harvesting is also currently on-going.

The coastal strip of Kenya and southern Somalia are also likely to receive light to moderate rains. The rest of eastern Horn is forecast to remain generally sunny and dry, as is seasonally normal.


# Doc4_FAOGIEWSSouthSudanCountryBriefSept2017 BG.pdf

According to the latest IPC analysis, famine conditions, previously reported in February 2017 in former Leer and Mayendit counties in former Unity State, were no longer occurring by late June 2017.Overall, the number of people facing IPC Phase 5: "Catastrophe" food security conditions declined from over 100 000 in February to about 45 000 in June due to sustained multi-sectoral humanitarian assistance operations and the two counties are currently classified as IPC Phase 4: "Emergency".

However, nationwide, the food insecure caseload (IPC Phases 3, 4 and 5) increased from about 5 million in February to a record high of 6 million in June as food access continues to be severely constrained by widespread insecurity, large scale displacements, high food prices, market disruptions, macro-economic collapse and exhaustion of households' coping mechanisms. The areas of major concern are Greater Jonglei and Unity states, where over 60 percent of the population faces "Crisis", "Emergency" and "Catastrophe" levels of food insecurity. In particular, the people facing catastrophic conditions are located in Ayod County in Greater Jonglei State and in Leer, Koch and Mayendit counties in Unity State.

Since the start of the conflict in mid-December 2013, about 3.9 million people were forced to flee their homes due to insecurity, including about 1.9 million IDPs and 2 million that sought refuge in neighbouring countries (Uganda, the Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and Kenya).

In southern bi-modal rainfall areas, harvesting of first season crops was concluded in August. Seasonal rains were above-average in the "green belt", including the former Central and Western Equatoria states, while in the former Eastern Equatoria State they started in late April with about a one-month delay. In northern and central uni-modal rainfall areas, harvesting of short cycle sorghum and maize crops has recently started, while long cycle sorghum crops will be gathered from November to January. Weather conditions have been generally favourable so far as seasonal rains have been average to above average, thus benefiting vegetation conditions.

However, prospects for 2017 aggregate cereal production are generally unfavourable as agricultural activities continue to be severely affected by the protracted and widespread insecurity, which is constraining farmers' access to fields and is causing large scale displacement of people, input shortages and damage to households' productive assets. In the traditionally surplus-producing areas of southern Greater Equatoria Region, crop production is expected to be lower than the already poor 2016 output due to recent massive displacements outside the former Central and Eastern Equatoria states. Notably, about 75 percent of the population of the former Central Equatoria State has reportedly left their living areas.

In addition, Fall Armyworm infestations have been reported in all regions of the country, with significant crop damage, especially in parts of former Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Eastern Equatoria and Central Equatoria states.

In the capital, Juba, prices of maize and sorghum more than doubled in the first semester of 2017, reaching record levels in June, driven by a tight supply situation, market disruptions, hyperinflation and a significant depreciation of the local currency. Subsequently, they declined by about 12 percent between June and August, following the first season harvest in southern bi-modal rainfall areas and the establishment, by the Government, of a trading company selling basic food commodities at subsidized prices. Prices of groundnuts decreased by 22 percent over the same period, while prices of wheat flour continued to soar in recent months, reaching new record highs in August. Overall, prices of these food staples in August were more than twice the high levels in August last year and up to 12 times higher than in the corresponding period two years earlier.


# Doc5_FEWS NET South Sudan Famine Risk Alert_20170117 BG.pdf

Extreme levels of food insecurity persist across South Sudan and nearly one third of the population is in need of emergency food assistance. Further deterioration in food security is likely during an extended lean season (February-July), as widespread insecurity continues to limit livelihoods, disrupt trade, and block humanitarian access. In a worst-case scenario where conflict intensifies and humanitarian access is further limited, Famine (IPC Phase 5), marked by high levels of excess mortality, is possible. Unity State, where displaced households already face an extreme lack of food, is the area of greatest concern. Urgent action to end conflict and increase the size and scope of emergency assistance delivery is critical to save lives over the coming year.

Since the resurgence of conflict in July 2016, violence has spread to Greater Equatoria, and now affects all regions of South Sudan. Over 450,000 people have fled the country since July, bringing the total number of refugees to 1.3 million. Nearly two million people are internally displaced. Across much of the country, household access to food and cash income has declined as conflict has disrupted planting, harvesting, and other livelihood activities. Ongoing crop assessments and key informant information indicate that 2016 staple food production is below average in many areas, including the typically surplus-producing areas of Western Equatoria.

Meanwhile, macroeconomic factors continue to drive exorbitant staple food prices. A substantial decline in oil revenue since 2014 has contributed to a sharp drop in both foreign currency reserves and the value of the South Sudanese pound. These factors, along with insecurity along key trade routes, have restricted normal trade flows into South Sudan and from the capital to wider areas of the country. This is occurring at a time when import requirements are higher than usual given below-average harvests. The subsequent reduction in food availability on local markets has driven prices to record levels. As of November 2016, retail sorghum prices in Aweil, Wau, and Juba averaged 49 SSD/kg, four times higher than the previous year and 10 to 15 times higher than November 2013, the month before the initial outbreak of conflict. These high prices, along with declining incomes, have significantly eroded household purchasing power.

All regions of South Sudan are in need of significant humanitarian response. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) is widespread and Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes exist in parts of Unity, Western Bahr el Ghazal, Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Central Equatoria, and Western Equatoria (Figure 1). An estimated 675,000 people are currently in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) or worse, meaning that they face large gaps in their ability to meet basic food requirements. These populations, particularly children, face a significantly elevated risk of malnutrition and mortality. An additional 2.8 million people are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). The prevalence of Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM), recorded by SMART surveys conducted between September and November 2016, remained Serious or worse (10 percent or higher) throughout the country during the harvest period.

Food security is expected to deteriorate further during the February to July lean season, and to be as severe as, or worse than, last year's lean season, when some food security outcomes in Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Western Bahr el Ghazal, and Unity States surpassed Emergency (IPC Phase 4) or Famine (IPC Phase 5) thresholds (Figure 2). In a worst-case scenario, where increased conflict further disrupts livelihoods and limits humanitarian assistance, Famine (IPC Phase 5) could occur during 2017.

Of greatest concern are Guit, Koch, Leer, and Panyijiar counties in Unity State. In these areas, Emergency (IPC Phase 4) levels of food insecurity observed during the 2016 lean season have likely persisted during the typical harvest period, as many households were unable to cultivate. Most continue to rely primarily on fish and wild foods to survive. Conflict is driving new displacement, putting additional stress on available wild food sources. Little to no food assistance was distributed in these counties from August to November due to access constraints.

Other areas of concern include: 1) Western Bahr el Ghazal, where conflict is also limiting agricultural activities, driving displacement, and disrupting normal market functioning; 2) Northern Bahr el Ghazal, where prices are extremely high and households are especially dependent on markets to access food; and 3) Greater Equatoria where ongoing conflict has disrupted crop production and restricted the movement of local populations. The forthcoming multi-partner IPC analysis will consider a variety of new information and provide an updated assessment of current and future acute food insecurity.

Urgent action to end the conflict, improve humanitarian access to severely food insecure populations, and increase size and scope of emergency assistance delivery is critical to save lives over the coming year.


#6 Doc6_FEWSNET South Sudan Outlook January 2018 BG.pdf

Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes persist in all regions of South Sudan in January. It is expected most households who harvested have depleted their stocks this month, three months earlier than was typical in pre-crisis years. As a result, the 2018 lean season has started earlier than normal and food security is expected to further deteriorate through the peak of the lean season in July/August. Given expected very low food access during this time, there remains a risk of Famine (IPC Phase 5) in a worst-case scenario of an extended absence of assistance. Urgent action is needed to end the ongoing conflict and allow for unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance.

There remains high concern for households in Greater Baggari, though it is expected many households in this area had access to some harvests and food security has marginally improved. However, it is expected some households in this area lack access to sufficient food and could be in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5)*. Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) also remains likely in parts of Nyirol, Leer, and Ayod, where some households did not harvest and ongoing insecurity is limiting access to assistance and movement towards natural food sources.

Despite the Cessation of Hostilities (COH) agreement signed in late December, armed clashes between Government forces and armed opposition continue in Unity, Central Equatoria, and parts of Western Equatoria. Additionally, tension remains high in parts of Jonglei, Lakes, and Warrap, where inter-communal clashes have occurred, and in central and southern Unity, due to the resurgence of various armed groups and an uptick in cattle raiding. Despite ongoing conflict in many areas, 250 IDPs from Bor PoC voluntarily returned to Fangak, and humanitarian partners supported the relocation of the remaining 562 IDPs in Melut PoC prior to the closure of the camp.

Data collection for the Food Security and Nutrition Monitoring System (FSNMS) has been completed in most counties of South Sudan. These data, collected in December and January, provide information on likely food security and nutrition outcomes during the post-harvest period. The South Sudan Technical Working Group will meet in late January/early February and utilize these data, and other recent assessments, to conduct an IPC analysis. This analysis will analyse current food security outcomes and project food security outcomes through July 2018.

According to the IPC, a Famine (IPC Phase 5) has occurred when at least 20 percent of households in a given area have an extreme lack of food, the Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) prevalence, as measured by weight-for-height z-score (WHZ), exceeds 30 percent, and mortality, as measured by the Crude Death Rate (CDR), is greater than 2 per 10,000 per day. Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) is when a household group has an extreme lack of food and/or other basic needs even with full employment of coping strategies.


#7 Doc7_FFP Fact Sheet_South Sudan_2018.01.17 BG.pdf

After nearly four years of civil conflict, South Sudan remains one of the most food-insecure countries in the world. By the end of the 2017 lean season in September--the period of the year when food is most scarce--approximately 56 percent of the country's population was facing life-threatening hunger and in need of humanitarian assistance, making 2017 the most food-insecure year in South Sudan's history.

Despite slight improvements in food availability due to seasonal harvests from October to December, the 2018 lean seasons began in January--three months earlier than usual--according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC). Food security is expected to deteriorate through March, with an estimated 5.1 million people--nearly half of the population--facing Crisis (IPC 3) or worse levels of acute food insecurity.*

In particular, ongoing conflict has severely affected areas of Western Bahr El Ghazal State, resulting in approximately 20,000 people experiencing Humanitarian Catastrophe levels of acute food insecurity--or famine at the household level--meaning that starvation, destitution and death are evident

As of January 2017, approximately 2.4 million refugees have fled South Sudan for neighboring countries and another 1.9 million South Sudanese remain internally displaced. Widespread insecurity continues to displace communities, disrupt livelihood activities, exacerbate food insecurity and impede humanitarian access to vulnerable populations.

A sustained and unimpeded humanitarian response is critical to saving lives and preventing a deterioration to Famine (IPC 5) levels of acute food insecurity. Since the start of the conflict, the USAID's Office of Food for Peace (FFP) and its partners--including the UN World Food Program (WFP) and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF)--have responded to the needs of South Sudan's most vulnerable and conflict-affected populations through emergency food and nutrition interventions. In FY 2017, FFP-supported programs provided life-saving food assistance to 1.1 million people per month, on average.

FFP also partners with Catholic Relief Services to provide families in Jonglei State with emergency food assistance, expand access to safe drinking water, and implement livelihoods interventions, including providing agricultural training for farming households.


#8 Doc8_i8533en.pdf

In South Sudan, the risk of famine remains elevated and food security is expected to worsen in 2018. It is critical to enable rapid food production among the most vulnerable communities, protect their livelihoods and build their resilience, while increasing self-sufficiency.

FAO is working with partners in the Food Security and Livelihoods Cluster to:

Provide emergency support to protect and rebuild livelihoods during the main planting and dry seasons to improve the food security of vulnerable urban and rural populations and reduce the food gap.

Strengthen the collection, analysis and coordination of food security and agriculture information.

Worsening food security trends linked to continued conflict have been compounded by market failure, internal displacement and decreasing humanitarian access. To save lives in the coming year, the most vulnerable households need support to produce nutritious food for consumption and sale.

Humanitarian response succeeded in containing famine soon after it was declared in February 2017. However, there is an elevated risk of famine in 2018 if widespread support is not continued. From January to March 2018, the number of severely food insecure people is likely to climb to 5.1 million people. This follows the trend seen since conflict began--rates of food insecurity accelerating even during the harvest season. Food insecurity levels worsen further with each lean season, a time of year when food stocks are typically depleted, food prices are at their highest and heavy rains disrupt markets and restrict humanitarian access. In 2018, the lean season is expected to start three months earlier than normal. Malnutrition levels remain well above emergency thresholds in some areas.

Persistent insecurity and massive displacement have led to widespread disruption of livelihood activities, including agricultural, fisheries and livestock production, as well as limited access to local food markets among producers, traders and consumers. Exacerbated by climate extremes and a reduction in area planted, the national cereal gap has widened. The shortfall of about half a million tonnes in 2017 is likely to be similar in 2018. Trade and migration routes have been disrupted, and the risk and occurrence of livestock disease outbreaks has increased. Economic crisis, marked by drastic hyperinflation and market failures, has further destabilised food systems and household access to food and income. Supporting local food production will remain critical to preventing further deterioration of the food security situation in 2018.

At least 1.5 million South Sudanese could face famine while up to 20,000 of them are experiencing famine conditions, a United Nations humanitarian officials told the Security Council on Wednesday.

"The next lean season, which begins in March, is likely to see food security worsen, and could see famine conditions spread to several new locations across the country," said Ursula Mueller, the deputy humanitarian coordinator.

She said access challenges have continued to delay and interrupt the humanitarian response in South Sudan. In Unity state, Mueller said, truck drivers delivering humanitarian supplies by road from Juba passed through 66 checkpoints.

More than 5 million South Sudanese or approximately half of the country's population are believed to be severely food insecure.

The anticipated food crisis is mainly attributed to the South Sudanese population's inability to plant or harvest due to war that has displaced millions of people.

In December 2017, the UN office for coordination of humanitarian affairs (OCHA) and the humanitarian community in South Sudan launched on an appeal for $1.7 billion to assist up to 6 million people affected by conflict, displacement and hunger.

Since the conflict in South Sudan began in December 2013, about 4 million people have reportedly been forced to flee their homes, including nearly 1.9 million people who have been internally displaced and over 2 million people who have fled as refugees to neighboring countries.

Last year alone, the world body and its partners reportedly reached over 5 million South Sudanese, providing assistance to people in critical need.

Floods caused by rain have displaced more than 100,000 people in South Sudan, an official said, raising fears about the devastating impact this could have on food security in the war-torn nation.

"We are talking of over 70,000 individuals and 1,590 households affected in Awiel and 40,000 others in Maban county. Other regions like Jonglei and Lol have also reported high figures," Gatwech Peter Kulang, the undersecretary for the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Risk Management told Xinhua Tuesday.

"The situation is alarming which demands urgent intervention," he added.

The official expressed concerns that the floods could worsen the already dire humanitarian situation across the country, including the spread of cholera, which has killed over 300 people and infected nearly 20,000 others last year.

"We call upon the humanitarian community to join hands with the government to rescue this alarming situation," stressed Kulang.

Much of South Sudan receives little rainfall and only 5% of the arable land is currently cultivated. Nonetheless, the country has significant potential for increased cereal production, especially in the southern regions with the highest annual rainfall. Accurate data on crop area and production for South Sudan are scarce, and there is considerable uncertainty in estimates.

Nearly 5 million people or more than 40% of the population in South Sudan were in need of urgent food, agriculture and nutrition assistance, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) projected early this year.
