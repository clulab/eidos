For city-level case reports in the USA, Australia, and Canada, which we began reporting on Feb 1, we rely on the US CDC, the government of Canada, the Australian Government Department of Health, and various state or territory health authorities. All manual updates (for countries and regions outside mainland China) are coordinated by a team at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nThe case data reported on the dashboard aligns with the daily Chinese CDC3 and WHO situation reports2 for within and outside of mainland China, respectively (figure). Furthermore, the dashboard is particularly effective at capturing the timing of the first reported case of COVID-19 in new\n\nAn interactive web-based dashboard to track COVID-19 in real time\n\nIn December, 2019, a local outbreak of pneumonia of initially unknown cause was detected in Wuhan (Hubei, China), and was quickly determined to be caused by a novel coronavirus,1 namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak has since spread to every province of mainland China as well as 27 other countries and regions, with more than 70 000 confirmed cases as of Feb 17, 2020.2 In response to this ongoing public health emergency, we developed an online interactive dashboard, hosted by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA, to visualise and track reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in real time. The dashboard, first shared publicly on Jan 22, illustrates the location and number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries for all affected countries. It was developed to provide researchers, public health authorities, and the general public with a userfriendly tool to track the outbreak as it unfolds. All data collected and displayed are made freely available, initially through Google Sheets and now through a GitHub repository, along with the feature layers of the dashboard, which are now included in the Esri Living Atlas.\n\nThe dashboard reports cases at the province level in China; at the city level in the USA, Australia, and Canada; and at the country level otherwise. During Jan 22-31, all data collection and processing were done manually, and updates were typically done twice a day, morning and night (US Eastern Time). As the outbreak evolved, the manual reporting process became unsustainable; therefore, on Feb 1, we adopted a semi-automated living data stream strategy. Our primary data source is DXY, an online platform run by members of the Chinese medical community, which aggregates local media and government reports to provide cumulative totals of COVID-19 cases in near real time at the province level in China and at the country level otherwise. Every 15 min, the cumulative case counts are updated from DXY for all provinces in China and for other affected countries and regions. For countries and regions outside mainland China (including Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan), we found DXY cumulative case counts to frequently lag behind other sources; we therefore manually update these case numbers throughout the day when new cases are identified. To identify new cases, we monitor various Twitter feeds, online news services, and direct communication sent through the dashboard. Before manually updating the dashboard, we confirm the case numbers with regional and local health departments, For the interactive dashboard of global COVID-19 cases see https://arcg.is/0fHmTX For coronavirus data at DXY see https://ncov.dxy.cn/ncovh5/ view/pneumonia For the COVID-19 data repository at GitHub see https://github.com/ CSSEGISandData/COVID-19\n\nFigure: Comparison of COVID-19 case reporting from different sources Daily cumulative case numbers (starting Jan 22, 2020) reported by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE), WHO situation reports, and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Chinese CDC) for within (A) and outside (B) mainland China.\n\nCo nfirm ed ca se s i n m ai na nd\n\nC hi na\n\n45 000 A\n\nB\n\n40 000\n\n35 000\n\n30 000\n\n25 000\n\n20 000\n\n15 000\n\n10 000\n\n0Co nfis o ut isd e o f m ai nl an d Ch in a 450\n\nJan 22 Jan 23 Jan 24 Jan 25 Jan 26 Jan 27 Jan 28 Jan 29 Jan 30 Jan 31 Fe b 0 1 Fe b 0 2 Fe b 0 3 Fe b 0 4 Fe b 0 5 Fe b 0 6 Fe b 0 7 Fe b 0 8 Fe b 0 9\n\nWHO Chinese CDC Johns Hopkins University CSSE\n\nWHO Johns Hopkins University CSSE\n\nLancet Infect Dis 2020\n\nPublished Online February 19, 2020 https://doi.org/10.1016/ S1473-3099(20)30120-1 www.thelancet.com/infection Published online February 19, 2020 https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30120-1 2\n\nWHO.
