The analysis is for the 2019/20 marketing year (MY), spanning from October 2019 to September 2020 and covering two main harvests-2019/2020 October-to-February harvest the 2020 June-to-August harvest. The June-to-August harvest data are early estimates and may be updated as data becomes available. This analysis was completed in mid-March, prior to the arrival of COVID-19 in many countries in the region. Future analysis will take into consideration any related impacts on market dynamics.\n\n• Wheat, maize, rice and, and sorghum are important staple foods in East Africa. Domestic sorghum production contributes 40 to 75 percent of national food supply in Sudan, Somalia and South Sudan and 10 to 14 percent in Ethiopia and Uganda.\n\n• Recent sorghum harvests concluded in East Africa by January. Preliminary production estimates suggest that of the three structurally surplus countries Sudan had a below average harvest, Uganda's harvest was average, and Ethiopia's production was well above average, (Figure 1 and Annex 1). After incorporating domestic demand, Ethiopia will have above-average surpluses while Sudan's will have a below average surplus (Figure 2). Regional surpluses will be 25 percent below average despite average total regional production (Annex 1). South Sudan's substantial import gap is expected to be filled through supplies from Sudan and Uganda.\n\n• Below average production will contribute to above average anticipated prices trends in South Sudan and Sudan, in the Somali region of Ethiopia and northern Somalia. However, these elevated prices are also largely driven by high inflation, currency depreciation and domestic conflict. The rest of the region is likely to have near average prices.\n\n• Given the below average surplus, market-based response activities of sorghum or any substitute commodities should consider the projected market and trade dynamics put forth in this report. Monitoring performance of upcoming harvests, ongoing macroeconomic issues, and any market reactions to COVID-19 will be essential in 2020.\n\nFigure 1.

The Regional Supply and Market Outlook report provides a summary of regional staple food availability, surpluses and deficits during the current marketing year, projected price behavior, implications for local and regional commodity procurement, and essential market monitoring indicators. FEWS NET gratefully acknowledges partner organizations, national ministries of agriculture, national market information systems, regional organizations, and others for their assistance in providing the harvest estimates, commodity balance sheets, as well as trade and price data used in this report.\n\nAggregate cereal production\n\n• The June-to-September main rainfall season in Ethiopia, Sudan, and South Sudan had a near-timely onset and accumulated average to above-average rainfall (Figure 3). In Ethiopia, the May-to-October rains were largely favorable for the cropping season and resulted in average to slightly above-average production. Flooding in parts of eastern and western Sudan, northern and eastern South Sudan, and southwestern, central, and northern Ethiopia has caused some crop losses in these areas. Following poor and erratic rainfall from April to June in Karan-receiving areas of northwest Somalia, heavy rainfall in August and September drove crop production recovery and significantly increased yields. Above-average rainfall since June drove recovery of the April-to-September rainfall season in Uganda's Karamoja sub-region which experienced a delayed start of season. The increase in rainfall supported the development of late-planted crops. However, production in Uganda remained moderately to slightly below average due to reduced area planted in Karamoja and more generalized early season crop losses.\n\n• While maize, wheat, and millet are also important crops to varying degrees in these countries, sorghum is the main locally produced and consumed crop in South Sudan, and significantly consumed in Sudan. Maize and wheat supplies are supported by imports from international markets, which are currently well supplied and at low price levels (Annex 3). This makes sorghum prices more dependent on domestic production. Sorghum is also more commonly consumed among poor, rural households, whereas the substitute maize and wheat are heavily consumed in urban areas.\n\n• Regional opening stocks for sorghum are estimated to be 21 percent higher than the recent five-year average level because of above average 2018/2019 production especially in the main producing countries of Uganda and Ethiopia. However, regional production is estimated to be average with below average production in Sudan, and average production in Uganda, two main regional exporters.\n\n• The estimated volumes of sorghum grain traded in the region in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 40,000MT (FEWS NET/MAS 2020). The amount was 46, 34 and 146 percent higher than the respective previous quarter, fourth quarter of 2018, and recent five-year average levels. Sudan and Uganda each accounted for over 40 percent of the total regional sorghum exports. South Sudan alone accounted for 84 percent of the imports. The increased exports by Sudan to South Sudan stemmed from easing of border restrictions by Sudan following changes in the government in an effort to support domestic prices; and extended period of relative calm in South Sudan that has opened up trade routes and expanded market functioning attracting inward supplies; also the main impetus for increased sorghum exports from Uganda to South Sudan. Still the low purchasing power in South Sudan due to poor economic situation continued to limit traders' capacity to import more. Exports from western Ethiopia to eastern areas of Sudan were occasioned by price differentials mostly because of high inflation in Sudan.\n\n• As an exclusively domestic and regionally traded commodity, international flows were not a factor in the supply or price dynamics of sorghum in the region. Sorghum prices are currently significantly above average in Ethiopia, Sudan, and South Sudan, and around average in Uganda and Somalia (Figure 4). While the government of Sudan tries to manage a gradual depreciation of the local currency, currency shortages persist despite strict withdrawal limits. This has led to a booming foreign exchange black market, widening the gap between the parallel and official exchange rates. This is expected to lead to further depreciation of the official exchange rate, sustaining elevated staple commodities prices, including sorghum. As the region's largest sorghum consumer, sorghum is essential to diets in Sudan, making the high prices a food access constraint for households across the country. Conflict driven macroeconomic problems, including currency depreciation and inflation; and insecurity-related disruptions in trade flows continue to sustain significantly above average sorghum prices in South Sudan, the region's second highest sorghum consumer in per capita terms. In Ethiopia, foreign exchange shortages, currency depreciation in the parallel market, and high inflation has sustained above average prices. In the Somali region of Ethiopia, prices are well above average even as both the domestic and import market has been liberalized to address the previous many market structural anomalies in that region.\n\n• Sorghum prices in South Sudan remain significantly above average levels in spite of the ongoing implementation of the 2018 Peace Agreement. This is attributed to persistent currency depreciation, high inflation, high marketing costs, and ad hoc insecurity-related trade disruptions especially outside Juba. Sorghum prices across most markets in Somalia are tending towards average levels because of average production, availability of substitute staple food commodities especially from livestock due to extended good rangeland conditions, and imported food aid. Finally, Uganda sorghum price levels are still similar to average levels in key reference markets due to high carryover stocks from the previous harvest amidst average 2019/2020 production.\n\nPROJECTED MARKET TRENDS FOR 2017/18\n\nDomestic and Regional Supply Levels\n\n• Domestic supply is projected to be significantly above average in Ethiopia among the usual three surplus-producing countries that also include Uganda and Sudan (Figure 5). Taking domestic demand into account, the estimated selfsufficiencies in the structurally surplus Ethiopia and Sudan indicate that the domestic supply will meet requirements this year with minor surpluses estimated at 12 and nine percent above the recent five-year average respectively. However, in Uganda, domestic supply will exceed local requirements, resulting in an average surplus of approximately 100,500 MT.\n\n• In the structurally deficit Somalia, the domestic balance is estimated to be 60 and 51 percent better than last year and the recent five-year average level because of above average production. In South Sudan, the domestic balance is projected to be significantly lower than last year and the recent five-year average level due to below average production. In terms of self-sufficiency, Somalia's domestic supply covers the smallest percent of its domestic demand at around 62%. While maize may act as a substitute in the central areas and southeastern areas, and imported rice in the northern region, the deficit of sorghum is an important one for the southwestern part of the country where sorghum is the dominant consumed crop. Sorghum self-sufficiency in South Sudan is estimated at 89%. While maize is also a substitute to sorghum in South Sudan, but availability is limited because of high prices, low-purchasing power, and insecurityrelated trade disruptions outside the main capital city of Juba.\n\n• Exports from Sudan production areas and most of Uganda to South Sudan will likely increase as relative calm settles in South Sudan following the beginning of implementation of peace agreement in South Sudan that will likely invigorate economic activities, pulling more supplies into the country. Although, competitive prices in Sudan as a result of currency depreciation will likely support sorghum exports to neighboring countries, high transport costs may inhibit exports from areas further away from South Sudan consumption markets.\n\n• Sorghum exports from Uganda to Kenya will likely continue to be limited by increasing demand for sorghum in Uganda's domestic alcohol production. Exports from Ethiopia to other regional markets is expected to be restrained because of lack of competitiveness except in localized cross border trade areas.\n\nPrice Trends\n\n• Ethiopia's estimated 35 percent above average 2019/2020 sorghum harvest is expected to increase domestic supply above 2018/2019 and recent five-year average levels. However, prices are still expected to be higher than last year because of increased sorghum demand as a result of persistent currency depreciation, high inflation, fuel shortages and high marketing costs which will also further increase the prices of wheat, barley and teffsubstitutes (Figure 6 and Figure 7).\n\n• In Sudan, hard currency shortages are expected to worsen despite strict withdrawal limits, leading to a booming foreign exchange parallel market, widening of the parallel and official exchange rates, which in turn will lead to further depreciation of the official exchange rate as the government tries to manage the gap between the official and parallel exchange rates. The prices of both imported and locally produced commodities including sorghum (Figure 6 and Figure 7) are expected to follow seasonal patterns in 2020 but the seasonal dips will likely not occur or be shallow and short-lived due to below average harvest. The prices will most likely remain higher than last year and five-year average levels because of accelerated currency depreciation, high inflation, elevated costs of production and transportation.\n\n• The marginal increase in 2019/2020 domestic sorghum supply in Uganda, amidst high domestic demand including human consumption, and industrial use that is expected to increase by about 17 percent will likely exert upward pressure on prices. Hence prices are expected to follow seasonal trends but remain above last year through August 2020 and similar to recent five-year average level (Figure 6 and Figure 7).\n\n• Somalia's, sorghum prices are projected to be below last year's levels but close to the recent five-year average because of average production in 2019/2020 and expectations of average to above average 2020/2021 production, imports of substitute rice, spaghetti and wheat by traders, and humanitarian aid distributions. (Figure 6 and Figure 8).\n\n• In South Sudan, domestic deficit of sorghum is expected to marginally higher than last year because of below average harvest. Sorghum prices in the main market of Juba will likely be higher than last year and recent five-year average levels because of persistent inflation occasioned by ongoing currency depreciation. Prices in markets further away from Juba are expected to remain significantly above last year and recent five-year average levels because of poor road conditions and corresponding high transport costs (Figure 6 and Figure 8).\n\nFigure 6. Percentage difference between projected 2020 maize prices and their 2019 and 5-year average levels in selected East African markets\n\nNote: This chart presents the percentage difference between projected 2020 prices relative to their 2019- and 5-year average levels. For example, the 2020 prices in Sudan are projected to be approximately 136 percent above the five-year average, and approximately 100 percent above 2019.\n\nEVENTS THAT COULD CHANGE THE OUTLOOK\n\nBased on the estimated available supplies in the region and expected regional market trends, the majority of the region is expected to experience high prices over the 2019/20 outlook period. There are some events that could exacerbate this situation or could potentially change this outlook.\n\nArea Event Impact on market outcomes Sudan and Ethiopia Further devaluation or\n\nFloating of local currency\n\nWould increase domestic prices of sorghum, reducing internal demand but reduce export parity prices boosting regional exports.\n\nUganda and Ethiopia\n\nElection-related insecurity Would like result is ad hoc trade disruptions resulting in localized higher food commodity prices.\n\nSouth Sudan Reduced/heightened level of conflict Enhance domestic and regional trade, increasing supplies and exerting downward pressure on prices. If the conflict level increases, domestic and regional trade will likely be disrupted exerting upward pressure on prices\n\nSomalia, South Sudan, and Ethiopia\n\nReduced food aid distributions\n\nWould result in higher prices reducing market access by some households, not only for sorghum but also its substitutes including maize, millet and wheat.\n\nMARKET MONITORING INDICATORS FOR 2019/20 MARKETING YEAR\n\nThere are a number of key indicators that are recommended for ongoing monitoring that may affect the evolution of markets.\n\nIndicator Justification Inflation Reduces purchasing power, reducing market demand, and mitigating price increase especially in South Sudan, Sudan and Ethiopia.\n\nLivestock prices and quantities\n\nAs the main source of income, the level of livestock prices and quantity sold would determine a household's ability to buy enough sorghum grain and flours in the market especially in Somalia.\n\nStaple sorghum grain and flour prices Accessibility by households to adequate staple foods depends on their market prices and volatility. Stable and relatively low prices make decision making by households more certain and increases the ability of most households to purchase enough across all countries.\n\nFood Aid distribution Relief grain and flour sales into the market has some significant localized impact on the prices of sorghum across all countries.\n\nLevel of civil strife and inter-communal conflict, and elections-related insecurity Further escalation of elections-related insecurity, civil conflict and or inter-communal clashes would likely disrupt supplies from source to consumption markets increasing local prices particularly in South Sudan and Somalia. Cross Border Trade Policies Uganda, South Sudan, Ethiopia, and Somalia usually do not control staple food imports and exports. However, Sudan occasionally control exports. This is likely to result in reduced domestic prices but high demand and prices in destination markets such as Eritrea and parts of central Somalia and northern South Sudan.\n\nGovernment wheat subsidies\n\nAlthough the governments of Sudan and Ethiopia are gradually but consistently moving away from expensive domestic targeted wheat subsidies, in areas where they are applied, the local prices wheat and substitute prices are likely to remain stable.\n\nPeace Agreement in South Sudan\n\nContinued implementation of the Peace Agreement in Sudan will likely improve the economic condition, business and trade environment, forthcoming production, resulting in downward pressure on prices. Delayed implementation of the agreement will likely prolong the current situation in which goodwill of all stakeholders is slightly improving the above parameters but there is uncertainty increasing risks to trade.\n\nAnnex 1. Global Cereal Supplies Global commodity markets remain well supplied with rice, wheat, and maize (Figure x1). 2019/20 global cereal supplies are projected to remain above average even with a year on year drop in maize production. Increased trade and demand activity will likely result in reduced carryover stocks despite expectations for higher rice and wheat stock levels (USDA and IGC). Stock-to-use ratios are projected to be above fiveyear average levels for rice and wheat but will remain below five-year average levels for maize.\n\nIn 2019, rice prices were on average increasing steadily while wheat and maize prices displayed more variability throughout the year (Figure x2). Global cereal prices are projected to increase moderately in 2020 (World Bank). However, current expectations for a downturn in global economic growth along with the uncertainty surrounding ongoing OPEC+ negotiations on production cut targets will likely influence the trajectory of global cereal prices in the coming months.\n\nKey risks for the global cereal market include uncertainty surrounding the long term impact of the coronavirus and a weakening global economy, domestic support and trade policy related risks, falling prices for minerals and raw materials, currency depreciation and inflation in emerging and developing economies, along with poor weather patterns or weather-related disasters in major producer and export countries.\n\nENSO-neutral is favored in the Northern Hemisphere spring 2020 (65 percent chance), and is likely to continue through summer 2020 with a 55 percent chance (NOAA). The impact of this forecast will vary geographically (Figure x3).\n\nFEWS NET will continue to monitor the global cereal market in the coming months as 2020/21 global commodity supply estimates are updated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), International Grains Council (IGC), the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS).\n\nFigure x1.
