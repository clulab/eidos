And where such tools are lacking, or poorly used, responsible leaders are expected to take action, plugging the gaps and enhancing execution.\n\nMuch has been done since the days of Pasteur to mitigate the threat of infectious diseases to individuals and humanity as a whole. Hygiene, water purification, vaccines, and antimicrobials have all contributed to great improvements in well-being and life expectancy. However, despite these advances, we have in the last few decades seen several large-scale outbreaks of infectious diseases, not only old foes-such as cholera and yellow fever-but new threats such as Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), hantavirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and novel strains of influenza. A range of factors, including increasing population, economic globalization, environmental degradation, and ever-increasing human interaction across the globe, are changing the dynamics of infectious diseases. As a consequence, we should anticipate a growing frequency of infectious disease threats to global security.\n\nWe have not done nearly enough to prevent or prepare for such potential pandemics. While there are certainly gaps in our scientific defenses, the bigger problem is that leaders at all levels have not been giving these threats anything close to the priority they demand. Ebola and other outbreaks revealed gaping holes in preparedness, serious weaknesses in response, and a range of failures of global and local leadership. This is the neglected dimension of global security.\n\nPart of the problem is the way this threat is perceived. Framed as a health problem, building better defenses against the threat of potential pandemics often gets crowded out by more visible and immediate priorities. As a result, many countries have underinvested in their public health infrastructure and capabilities. And global agencies, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the rest of the United Nations system, have lacked the focus and capacity to provide the required international support and coordination.\n\nYet, framed as an issue of human security, the current level of investment in countering this threat to human lives looks even more inadequate. There are very few threats that can compare with infectious diseases in terms of their potential to result in catastrophic loss of life. Yet nations devote only a fraction of the resources spent on national security to prevent and to prepare for pandemics.\n\nFramed as a threat to economic growth and stability, the contrast is equally stark. Both the dynamics of infectious disease and the actions taken to counteract it can cause immense damage to societies and economies. And in a globalized, media-connected world, national borders are no barriers to real or perceived threats. Fears, whether rational or unwarranted, spread even more quickly than infections. And such fears drive changes in behavior and public policy, often leading governments to implement non-scientifically-based actions that exacerbate economic vi impact, such as travel bans, quarantines, and blockades on the importation of food, mail, and other items. Yet both at the level of individual countries and at the global level, there has been remarkably little analysis and preparation for potential pandemics as a source of economic risk.\n\nMoreover, while economic or financial problems in fragile or failed states pose very little direct risk to the rest of the world, infectious disease outbreaks in such states represent a direct threat. The lack of health care and public health capacity in these countries is both a disaster for their own populations and an acute vulnerability for the world as a whole. The recent Ebola outbreak showed how fragile post-civil-war nations can serve as incubators for infections of global pandemic potential. Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone are far from being major engines of the African economy, let alone the global economy, but the sparks that came out of their remote jungles ignited an enormously expensive global reaction. Moreover, it could have been much worse. If Ebola had spread to much bigger, more globally integrated cities, such as Lagos, Nairobi, or Kinshasa-Brazzaville, it would have been a very different story. Indeed, we saw the impact of an infectious disease spreading rapidly through urban centers around the world in 2003 when SARS emerged from China.\n\nIt was against the backdrop of the Ebola outbreak that the Commission on a Global Health Risk Framework for the Future was conceived. While Ebola was the catalyst, the aim of this exercise was to look to the future, taking a broad view of the potential threats from infectious diseases, without putting particular emphasis on a single outbreak or agent. Indeed, our objective was to set out a framework of institutions, policy, and finance that would be resilient to a wide range of such potential threats, whether known-such as influenzas, coronaviruses, and haemorrhagic fevers-or as yet unknown.\n\nThe Commission was established in response to an urgent need. Eight philanthropic and government sponsors recognized the crisis of Ebola, the underlying neglect of health systems around the globe, and the associated peril for economies and security. Because of its extensive history of managing complex advisory studies, these sponsors asked the U.S. National Academy of Medicine (NAM, formerly the Institute of Medicine) to provide staff to support the Commission in carrying out its task in a comprehensive, rigorous, and objective manner. While the NAM provided staff expertise, the Commission's report should be regarded as independent of the NAM and all other organizations. The Commission's task was to provide peer-reviewed consensus recommendations based on evidence and expert opinion. The 17 members of the Commission include citizens of a dozen countries, and its peer reviewers are similarly balanced. Rather than following the well-established procedures of the NAM, the process and policies of the Commission were informed by them and customized to reflect the international nature of this effort and the constrained timeframe. An Independent Oversight Group, composed of 12 eminent and diverse leaders from Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Europe, provided oversight. To ensure that the Commission drew on insights and expertise across the globe, it was informed through a total of 11 days of public meetings held in Accra, Ghana; Hong Kong; London; and Washington, DC. More than 250 invited presenters offered their perspectives at these events.\n\nThe Commission's recommendations encompass three broad areas: first, reinforcing national public health capabilities and infrastructure as the foundation of a country's health system and the first line of defense against potential pandemics; second, reinforcing international leadership and coordination for preparedness and response; and third, accelerating research and development in the infectious disease arena. Together, these recommendations amount to a comprehensive, costed, and coherent framework to make the world much safer against the threat of infectious disease.\n\nInevitably, there will be discussion as to which of the Commission's recommendations are most important and which are the hardest to implement. Four observations are perhaps worth making in this context. First, a policy framework is most effective when the various elements combine to complement each other. Partial implementation makes even those elements that are put in place less efficacious. Second, we should heed the oft-learned lesson that, in this arena as in others, investment in prevention and preparation is worth much more than spending on response, and that the best response is a well-prepared response. Third, ultimately the fight against infectious disease outbreaks will be fought on the ground within specific communities, and the battle will only be won if these communities are engaged with and part of the response. Finally, science is our most powerful weapon in combating infectious diseases, vii but the development of tools such as vaccines and diagnostics must be begun before the crisis occurs. Otherwise, the time it takes to deploy scientific tools effectively could be immensely costly in terms of lives and livelihoods.\n\nSo, while we should reinforce international mechanisms to lead, coordinate, and resource the response to infectious disease crises, including strengthening WHO's capabilities and creating contingency financing mechanisms through WHO and the World Bank, we should avoid the temptation to see such initiatives as being in any respect a complete answer. These may be the most visible actions, and perhaps the least difficult to achieve, but that does not mean they are the most important.\n\nTo make a truly significant impact in reducing the risks to humanity and to human prosperity, we must catalyze the building of stronger public health capabilities and infrastructure at a national level, even in failed and fragile states, and do so in a way that establishes effective community engagement. We do not underestimate the difficulties in achieving this, because it requires leadership at multiple levels and sustained financing. Yet this must be the top priority.\n\nNeither do we underestimate the challenges of mobilizing additional funds for research and development in the infectious disease arena, or of achieving greater harmonization and efficiency in development and approval processes. Yet ultimately, we depend on science to enable us to counter potential pandemics. So we need to find the money and make our processes less complex and cumbersome.\n\nInfectious disease pandemics represent one of the potent threats to humankind, both in terms of potential lives lost and in terms of potential economic disruption. The Commission's recommendations represent a framework for making the world much safer. Now the challenge is to make them happen.\n\nPeter Sands, Chair Commission on a Global Health Risk\n\nFramework for the Future ix\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe Commission wishes to thank colleagues, organizations, and agencies that shared their expertise throughout the course of the study.

The underlying rate of emergence of infectious diseases appears to be increasing, most likely due to the growing human population and consequent greater food production and animal-human interaction. Contagion risks are also larger as globalization and urbanization drive travel and trade, creating everincreasing personal interaction and interdependence.\n\nInfectious diseases remain one of the biggest risks facing humankind. Few events are capable of equal damage to human lives and livelihoods. Yet the global community spends relatively little to protect populations from the risks of pandemics. Compared with other highprofile threats to human and economic security-such as war, terrorism, nuclear disasters, and financial crises- we are underinvested and underprepared. This is the neglected dimension of global security.\n\nThe Ebola epidemic was both a tragedy and a wakeup call. The outbreak revealed deficiencies in almost every aspect of global defenses against potential pandemics. Disease surveillance proved inadequate. Alerts were escalated too slowly. Local health systems were quickly overwhelmed. Communities lost trust. Governments elsewhere in the world reacted haphazardly to the threat of contagion. The international response was sluggish, ill-coordinated, and clumsy.\n\nEventually, we made great progress toward containing Ebola, thanks to the courage and determination of health care workers and community leaders on the ground and a massive deployment of resources by the international community. But more lives were lost than should have been, and the economic costs were far greater than they could have been.\n\nBefore the memories of Ebola fade, we should heed this call. Global health security is a global public good- making each of us safer depends on making all of us safer; holes in one community's defenses are holes in all of our defenses. Global leaders must therefore commit to creating and resourcing a comprehensive global framework to counter infectious disease crises. We cannot afford to continue to neglect this risk to global security.\n\nTHE CASE FOR INVESTING IN PANDEMIC PREPAREDNESS\n\nThere is a strong case for investing more to make the world safer from the threat of potential pandemics. Although there are enormous uncertainties in modeling the risks and potential impact of infectious disease crises, the case is compelling no matter how it is calculated. The po-\n\nPandemics and epidemics have killed countless millions throughout human history. Highly virulent infectious diseases, such as the plague, cholera, and influenza, have repeatedly swept through human societies, causing death, economic chaos, and, as a consequence, political and social disorder. In the past 100 years, the 1918 influenza pandemic killed approximately 50 million (CDC, 2014); HIV/AIDS took the lives of more than 35 million (CDC, 2013). Although more recently-emerging epidemics, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, H1N1 in 2009-and, most recently, the Ebola epidemic in West Africa-have had lower death tolls, they have nevertheless had a huge impact in terms of both social and economic disruption.\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY2 tential losses in terms of human lives and livelihoods are immense. The economic costs alone can be catastrophic. By our calculation, the annualized expected loss from potential pandemics is more than $60 billion.1 Against this, we propose incremental spending of about $4.5 billion per year-a fraction of what we spend on other risks to humankind. Framed as a risk to human security, this is a compelling investment. Framed as a risk to economic growth and stability, it is equally convincing.\n\nMoreover, the risks of spending too much or too little are asymmetric. Even if we have overestimated the risks of potential pandemics, money invested to mitigate them will still be money well spent. Most of the investments we recommend will help achieve other high-priority health goals, such as countering antimicrobial resistance and containing endemic diseases like tuberculosis and malaria. Yet if we spend too little, we open the door to a disaster of terrifying magnitude. The Commission therefore recommends the following:\n\nThe G7, G20, and United Nations (UN), under the leadership of the UN Secretary General, should reinforce and sustain international focus and actions to protect human lives and livelihoods from the threat of infectious diseases by:\n\nRecommendation A.1: Committing to implementing the framework set out in the report The Neglected Dimension of Global Security: A Framework to Counter Infectious Disease Crises and embodied in Recommendations B.1-D.3.\n\nRecommendation A.2: Committing and mobilizing the incremental financial resources required to implement the framework, as set out in the report The Neglected Dimension of Global Security: A Framework to Counter Infectious Disease Crises, which amount to about $4.5 billion per year.\n\nRecommendation A.3: Monitoring progress of implementation by commissioning an independent assessment in 2017 and every 3 years thereafter.\n\nSTRENGTHENING PUBLIC HEALTH AS THE FOUNDATION OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM AND FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE\n\nRobust public health infrastructure and capabilities are the foundation of resilient health systems and the first line of defense against infectious disease outbreaks that could become pandemics. Yet far too many countries have failed to build the necessary capabilities and infrastructure. Even by their own internal assessments, 67 percent of the World Health Organization (WHO) member states fail to meet the requirements of the 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR) (WHO, 2015); objective external evaluations would almost certainly reveal even lower rates of compliance.\n\nPrevious international efforts to galvanize greater commitment to building resilient public health systems have largely failed. After every outbreak of infectious disease, there is a flurry of activity and reports, but political interest quickly wanes and other priorities dominate.\n\nBuilding and sustaining strong health systems is achievable with leadership and commitment, at the national, provincial, and local levels, even in relatively poor countries. Countries like Uganda have demonstrated that creating resilient and effective public health systems that can identify and contain infectious disease outbreaks is not beyond reach. What is required is leadership. Governments must recognize that protecting against the threat of infectious disease is a fundamental part of their basic duty to protect their citizens.\n\nBuilding effective public health systems requires more than surveillance systems, laboratory networks, and clinical capabilities. Engaging and communicating with communities is critical. Community awareness enhances surveillance. Trust and cooperation of the local population is a vital component of any response strategy.\n\nAlso essential is clarity about the benchmark attributes of a highly-functioning public health system and transparency about actual achievement against these benchmarks. Therefore, we need a clear definition of the core capacities required to deliver according to the IHR requirement-plus regular, rigorous, and objective assessments of delivery against these benchmarks. Publication of such assessments will enable civil society to hold governments accountable and facilitate prioritization and the monitoring of progress.\n\nWe make 10 recommendations about building more effective public health infrastructure and capabilities at the national level as the foundation of a more resilient health system and the first line of defense against potential pandemics.\n\nFirst, we need clear definitions of the required infrastructure, capabilities, and benchmarks for effective functioning for a national public health system.\n\nRecommendation B.1: The World Health Organization, in collaboration with member states, should develop an agreed-on, precise definition and benchmarks for national core capabilities and functioning, based on, and implemented through, the International Health Regulations and building on the experiences of other efforts, including the Global Health Security Agenda and the World Organization for Animal Health Terrestrial Animal Health Code by the end of 2016. Benchmarks should be designed to provide metrics against which countries will be independently assessed (see Recommendation B.2).\n\nSecond, we also need a regular, independent, and objective mechanism to evaluate country performance and to ensure publication of the results. This is essential for prioritization, progress monitoring, and accountability.\n\nRecommendation B.2: The World Health Organization should devise a regular, independent, transparent, and objective assessment mechanism to evaluate country performance against the benchmarks defined in Recommendation B.1, building on current International Health Regulations monitoring tools and Global Health Security Agenda assessment pilots, by the end of 2016.\n\nThird, all countries must agree to participate. Otherwise, we will encounter adverse selection, with those most needing evaluation declining to participate.\n\nRecommendation B.3: By the end of 2016, all countries should commit to participate in the external assessment process as outlined in Recommendation B.2, including publication of results.\n\nFourth, to reinforce the incentive to participate in the assessment mechanism, international partners should make clear to countries needing assistance that support is subject to participation in this mechanism. For countries in need of external support to reinforce their core capacities, the assessment process will establish a clear starting point and enable prioritization of actions to fill gaps.\n\nRecommendation B.4: The World Bank, bilateral, and other multilateral donors should declare that funding related to health system strengthening will be conditional upon a country's participation in the external assessment process.\n\nTo underscore the importance of pandemic preparedness as a way of protecting economic growth and stability, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) should routinely incorporate the results of the external assessment of national core capacities in its economic evaluations of individual countries. The IMF should also consider non-participation in the assessment process a signal of a country's lack of commitment to managing economic risk.\n\nRecommendation B.5: The International Monetary Fund should include pandemic preparedness in its economic and policy assessments of individual countries, based on outcomes of the external assessment of national core capacities as outlined in Recommendation B.2.\n\nThe primary responsibility for achieving and sustaining public health infrastructure and capabilities of the required standard rests with national governments. We therefore call on national governments to develop and publish plans by mid-2017 (where plans do not already exist) to achieve benchmark status in the required core capacities by 2020. Plans should be comprehensive and realistic, addressing the challenges of sustainable financing and skills building.\n\nRecommendation B.6: Countries should develop plans to achieve and maintain benchmark core capacities (as defined in Recommendations B.1). These plans should be published by mid-2017, with a target to achieve full compliance with the benchmarks by 2020. These plans should include sustainable resourcing components, including both financing and skills.\n\nWHO should provide technical assistance to national governments seeking to rectify deficiencies in\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY4 their public health core capacities by building skills and transferring best practices.\n\nRecommendation B.7: The World Health Organization (WHO) should provide technical support to countries to fill gaps in their core capacities and achieve benchmark performance. (Technical support will be coordinated through a WHO Center for Health Emergency Preparedness and Response; see Recommendation C.1.)\n\nBecause national governments must take responsibility for protecting their citizens from the threat of infectious disease, the primary source of funding for building and maintaining public health core capacities must be their own domestic budgets. This is also the best way of ensuring the funding is stable and sustained.\n\nWe therefore call on the governments of upperand upper-middle-income countries to ensure that sufficient funding for public health systems is incorporated in their national budgets. Lower-middle- and low-income countries need to adequately invest in domestic core capacities. In addition, there may be a need for external assistance to rectify deficiencies and build capabilities. Importantly, even lower-income governments should seek to devise pathways to full domestic resourcing.\n\nRecommendation B.8: National governments should develop domestic resourcing plans to finance improvement and maintenance of core capacities as set out in the country-specific plans described in Recommendation B.6. For upper- and upper-middle-income countries, these plans should cover all financing requirements. For lower-middle- and low-income countries, these plans should seek to develop a pathway to full domestic resourcing, with a clear timetable for achieving the core capacity benchmarks.\n\nGiven that lower-middle- and low-income countries are likely to need financial assistance in filling gaps and strengthening their public health systems, the World Bank should convene other multilateral donors, bilateral donors, and other philanthropic sources to cultivate financial support for such plans. This support should be contingent on (1) the plan's inclusion of a pathway to full domestic resourcing and (2) the recipient country's cooperation with the external assessment process (see Recommendation B.2).\n\nRecommendation B.9: The World Bank should convene other multilateral donors (including the African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, New Development Bank, United Nations Development Program, and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank) and development partners by mid-2017 to secure financial support for lower-middle- and low-income countries in delivering the plans outlined in Recommendation B.6.\n\nFragile states, failed states, and warzones pose a particular problem for the maintenance of basic public health infrastructure and capabilities. For these situations, we recommend that the UN Secretary General takes the lead, working with WHO and other parts of the UN system to sustain at least minimal public health capacities within the context of the broader UN strategy for each particular circumstance.\n\nRecommendation B.10: The United Nations (UN) Secretary General should work with the World Health Organization and other parts of the UN system to develop strategies for sustaining health system capabilities and infrastructure in fragile and failed states and in warzones, to the extent possible.\n\nSTRENGTHENING GLOBAL COORDINATION AND CAPABILITIES\n\nWhile reinforcing the first line of defense at the country level is the foundation of a more effective global framework for countering the threat of infectious diseases, strengthening international coordination and capabilities is the next most vital component. Pandemics know no borders, so international cooperation is essential. Global health security is a global public good requiring collective action.\n\nEbola revealed significant shortcomings in the functioning and performance of the international public health system. Neither WHO, the UN system, nor regional entities escaped criticism. There were failures of execution, coordination, and leadership at multiple levels.\n\nThe Commission believes that an empowered WHO must take the lead in the global system to identify, prevent, and respond to potential pandemics. There is no realistic alternative. However, we believe that WHO must make significant changes in order to play this role effectively. It needs more capability and more resources, and it must demonstrate more leadership.\n\nFirst, WHO needs to establish a dedicated and wellresourced operational center for coordinating preparedness and response. This should be a dedicated center, not a program-reflecting its status as a permanent and critical component of WHO's role. Furthermore, this center should be guided and overseen by a Technical Governing Board (TGB). The TGB should be chaired by the Director-General, but otherwise its composition should comprise members who are independent of and drawn from outside WHO on the basis of technical expertise.\n\nRecommendation C.1: By the end of 2016, the World Health Organization should create a Center for Health Emergency Preparedness and Response- integrating action at headquarters, regional, and country office levels-to lead the global effort toward outbreak preparedness and response. This center should be governed by an independent Technical Governing Board.\n\nThe WHO Center for Health Emergency Preparedness and Response (CHEPR) will need sustainable funding. To achieve this, there should be an appropriate increase in member states' core contributions. These required contributions are a better resource than relying on voluntary contributions, which are often unpredictable and ultimately unsustainable, to support a core function of WHO.\n\nRecommendation C.2: In May 2016, the World Health Assembly should agree to an appropriate increase in the World Health Organization member states' core contributions to provide sustainable financing for the Center for Health Emergency Preparedness and Response.\n\nWe support the World Health Assembly's resolution to create a $100 million contingency fund to enable rapid response to health emergencies, including infec- tious disease outbreaks. We believe one-offcontributions or binding contingent commitments proportional to member state core contributions are the most efficient way to finance this fund.\n\nRecommendation C.3: By the end of 2016, the World Health Organization should create and fund a sustainable contingency fund of $100 million to support rapid deployment of emergency response capabilities through one-offcontributions or commitments proportional to assessed contributions from member states.\n\nEbola revealed weaknesses in WHO's coordination with other parts of the UN system. WHO and the UN should address the need for coordination, agreeing on effective mechanisms for crises that are primarily healthdriven as well as those that pose broader humanitarian challenges. The composition of the TGB, which will include representation from other parts of the UN system, will facilitate this. Where a potential pandemic goes beyond the capacity of WHO and/or becomes a broader humanitarian crisis-or where the health challenges are just one element of a broader crisis-there should be an agreed-on escalation process, facilitating the UN Secretary-General's overall control of such situations.\n\nRecommendation C.4: By the end of 2016, the United Nations (UN) and the World Health Organization should establish clear mechanisms for coordination and escalation in health crises, including those that become or are part of broader humanitarian crises requiring mobilization of the entire UN system.\n\nRegional networks have an important role to play, complementing the regional structure of WHO. They can enhance cross-border cooperation, facilitate the sharing of scarce resources, and provide extra capacity in the event of outbreaks. WHO needs to recognize the value of such networks and improve its linkages with them.\n\nRecommendation C.5: By the end of 2017, the World Health Organization should work with existing formal and informal regional and sub-regional networks to strengthen linkages and coordination, and thus enhance mutual support and trust, sharing of informa-\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY6 tion and laboratory resources, and joint outbreak investigations among neighboring countries.\n\nThe Ebola outbreak demonstrated the importance of non-state actors-from community leaders to international nongovernmental organizations and privatesector businesses. It also revealed many shortcomings in approaches taken at both the national and global level to engage with such players. WHO and individual national governments should proactively create mechanisms to engage with the various categories of non-state actors on preparedness and response. Waiting until the crisis hits is too late.\n\nRecommendation C.6: By the end of 2016, the World Health Organization and national governments should enhance means of cooperation with non-state actors, including local and international civil society organizations, the private sector, and the media.\n\nAt the moment there is no formalized intermediate level of public alert below a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), which is an extremely rare event. The Commission believes that there would be merit in generating a daily \"watch list\" of outbreaks of PHEIC potential. The CHEPR should develop clear criteria to determine the outbreaks included in this list. This would raise awareness of the underlying pattern of potential threats and normalize the process of raising alerts.\n\nRecommendation C.7: By the end of 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) should establish a mechanism to generate a daily high-priority \"watch list\" of outbreaks with potential to become a Public Health Emergency of International Concern to normalize the process of reporting of outbreaks by country and encourage necessary preparedness activities. WHO should communicate this list to national focal points on a daily basis and provide a public summary on a weekly basis.\n\nSelf-interested and misguided behavior by individual countries can be an impediment to an effective international response to infectious disease threats, whether by delaying or suppressing data or alerts or by imposing excessive restrictions on travel and trade. We believe the global community should establish tougher norms and pursue greater compliance in these areas-and be prepared to \"name and shame\" where necessary.\n\nRecommendation C.8: By the end of 2016, the World Health Assembly should agree on new mechanisms for holding governments publicly accountable for performance under the International Health Regulations and broader global health risk framework, as detailed in Recommendation B.2, including: • protocols for avoiding suppression or delays in data and alerts, and • protocols for avoiding unnecessary restrictions on trade or travel.\n\nWe support the World Bank's proposal to create a Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility as a complement to WHO's contingency fund. If innovative insurance and capital market mechanisms can be demonstrated to be both economically viable and practical, these could potentially represent an attractive new source of funds. While clearly politically challenging to implement, binding contingent commitments from donor governments represent an economic and flexible alternative.\n\nRecommendation C.9: By the end of 2016, the World Bank should establish the Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility as a rapidly deployable source of funds to support pandemic response.\n\nTo ease fiscal pressure on governments that raise infectious disease outbreak alerts, and reduce the incentive to avoid doing so, the IMF should make clear that it is in a position to provide budgetary assistance when needed.\n\nRecommendation C.10: By the end of 2016, the International Monetary Fund should ensure that it has the demonstrable capability to provide budgetary support to governments raising alerts of outbreaks, perhaps through its existing Rapid Credit Facility.\n\nACCELERATING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TO COUNTER INFECTIOUS DISEASES\n\nAs part of creating a more effective global framework to counter infectious disease threats, we need to strengthen our scientific and technical resources against these threats. This means accelerating research and development (R&D) in a coordinated manner across the whole range of relevant medical products, including vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostic tools, personal protective equipment, and instruments.\n\nTo ensure that incremental R&D has maximum impact in strengthening defenses against infectious diseases, we propose that WHO galvanize the creation of a Pandemic Product Development Committee (PPDC) to mobilize, prioritize, allocate, and oversee R&D resources relating to infectious diseases with pandemic potential. The chair of the PPDC should be an R&D expert appointed by the WHO DirectorGeneral, with the rest of the membership comprised of internationally recognized leaders with expertise in discovery, development, regulatory review and approval, and manufacturing of medical products. Although supported by WHO, the PPDC should operate independently and should be held accountable by the TGB. To facilitate this linkage, the chair of the PPDC should be a member of the TGB.\n\nRecommendation D.1: By the end of 2016, the World Health Organization should establish an independent Pandemic Product Development Committee, accountable to the Technical Governing Board, to galvanize acceleration of relevant research and development, define priorities, and mobilize and allocate resources.\n\nAccelerating R&D will require a significant financial investment. We recommend mobilization of about $1 billion per year (as part of the total investment proposed of $4.5 billion). Deployment of these funds, which we envision as being sourced from a variety of contributors, will be coordinated by the PPDC.\n\nRecommendation D.2: By the end of 2016, the World Health Organization should work with global research and development stakeholders to catalyze the commitment of $1 billion per year to maintain a portfolio of projects in drugs, vaccines, diagnostics, personal protective equipment, and medical devices coordinated by the Pandemic Product Development Committee.\n\nEnhancing the effectiveness of R&D requires agreement on protocols and approaches in a number of key aspects of the way R&D is conducted, including commitment to scientific standards during a crisis, engagement of communities, and harmonization of multiple aspects of development and approval, and manufacturing and distribution processes.\n\nRecommendation D.3: By the end of 2016, the Pandemic Product Development Committee should convene regulatory agencies, industry stakeholders, and research organizations to: • Commit to adopting research and development approaches during crises that maintain consistently high scientific standards. • Define protocols and practical approaches to engage local scientists and community members in the conduct of research. • Agree on ways to expedite medical product approval, manufacture, and distribution, including convergence of regulatory processes and standards; pre-approval of clinical trial designs; mechanisms for intellectual property management, data sharing and product liability; and approaches to vaccine manufacture, stockpiling, and distribution.\n\nBUILDING A GLOBAL FRAMEWORK TO\n\nCOUNTER INFECTIOUS DISEASE CRISES For far too long, infectious disease has been the neglected dimension of global security. Few threats pose such risks to human life and well-being. Yet we have invested relatively little to counter such risks, and neither national nor global systems performed well when tested.\n\nThe Commission believes the time has come to reverse this neglect. The framework we propose has three key elements: 1. Stronger national public health capabilities, infra- structure, and processes built to a common standard and regularly assessed through an objective, transparent process fully consistent with international legal obligations under the IHR.\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY8\n\n2. More effective global and regional capabilities, led by a reenergized WHO, through a dedicated CHEPR, coordinated effectively with the rest of the UN system, and supported by the World Bank and IMF. 3. An accelerated program of R&D, deploying $1 billion per year and coordinated by a dedicated committee.\n\nThese actions have a price tag. We estimate an incremental funding requirement of about $4.5 billion per year. This comprises: • The upper end of the World Bank's 2012 estimated range of $1.9-$3.4 billion per year for the cost of upgrading national pandemic preparedness capabilities (World Bank, 2012). • Our proposed figure of $1 billion per year for infectious disease prevention and response R&D (see Chapter 5). • High-level preliminary estimates of costs for the establishment of WHO's CHEPR ($25 million), WHO's Contingency Fund for Emergencies ($25-$30 million) and the World Bank's Pandemic\n\nEmergency Financing Facility ($80-$100 million), which amount together to about $130-$155 million per year (see Chapter 4).\n\n$4.5 billion is not a small sum, but neither is it beyond reach. In the context of estimated expected economic losses from pandemics of more than $60 billion per year, it is very good investment. Considering the potential threat to human lives, the case is even stronger.\n\nREFERENCES CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). 2013.

Moreover, these three countries had never experienced an Ebola outbreak before making this an unexpected and more challenging situation to respond to. All this contributed to widespread fear and questioning of the ability and willingness of governments and humanitarian agencies to respond effectively, and, in many places, people were reluctant to seek health services (WHO, 2015a). These and many other factors contributed to an outbreak with devastating health, economic, and social impacts.\n\nPast outbreaks of other diseases, including H1N1 influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), have also had significant economic and social impacts. These outbreaks, like Ebola, exposed weaknesses in national health systems and the global public health response, but did not galvanize the degree of reform required. This most recent Ebola outbreak triggered several initiatives calling for change: • The World Economic Forum (WEF), in collabora- tion with the Boston Consulting Group, published Managing the Risk and Impact of Future Epidemics:\n\nOptions for Public-Private Collaboration in June 2015. This report explored the role of public-private partnership when responding to epidemics, using lessons learned from the Ebola response (WEF, 2015). • In January 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) Executive Board's special session on Ebola adopted Resolution EBSS.R1, establishing an independent, expert panel to evaluate WHO's response to the Ebola crisis. The panel was established in March 2015 and released its report in July 2015 (WHO, 2015b). • The Harvard Global Health Institute and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine set up the Independent Panel on the Global Response to Ebola to create actionable change through assessment of the global response. This report was released on November 23, 2015 (Moon et al., 2015). • The United Nations (UN) High-Level Panel on Global Response to Health Crises was convened by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. This panel will make recommendations on the basis of a wide range of consultations across sectors and in affected communities, and will submit its final report to the Secretary-General in early 2016 (UN SecretaryGeneral, 2015).\n\nWith failures occurring at all levels, the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa exposed significant weaknesses in the global health system and culminated in a tragic humanitarian disaster. At the national level in affected countries, there was significant delay in acknowledging the magnitude of the outbreak. And after the outbreak was recognized, the international response was slow and uncoordinated. Mechanisms for the establishment of public-private partnerships were lacking. For example, the development of lifesaving medical products was reactive, rather than proactive. An easily mobilized reserve of funds to support the response was not available. Critical financial and human resources were slow to arrive or never arrived at all. Countries were reluctant to acknowledge the severity of the outbreak and obstructed early notification. Surveillance and information systems were not in place or failed to provide early warning.\n\nIntroduction 1\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY10\n\n• Finally, to address deficiencies in the financing of outbreak response, the World Bank Group has launched an initiative to create a Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (PEF). The PEF is expected to provide financial resources for global health emergencies to allow for the rapid deployment of equipment, medications, and human resources (World Bank, 2015).\n\nFor additional information on these relevant initiatives, see Table 1-1.\n\nORIGIN OF THE PRESENT REPORT\n\nThe National Academy of Medicine (NAM), internationally known for rigorous procedures to ensure independence and the ability to convene experts with broad multi-disciplinary reach, was encouraged by multiple stakeholders to assemble global experts to develop a plan for future preparedness and response to global infectious disease threats. After two planning meetings, the NAM became Secretariat for the Global Health Risk Framework for the Future (GHRF) initiative-an international, independent, evidence-based, authoritative, multi-stakeholder expert commission process to generate a comprehensive report with recommendations for improving governance and finance in matters of global health security pertinent to infectious disease outbreaks of international concern. The initiative received support from the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation, the Ford Foundation, The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Mr.\n\nMing Wai Lau, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, The Rockefeller Foundation, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and the Wellcome Trust.\n\nCHARGE TO THE COMMISSION\n\nThe GHRF Commission was tasked with conducting a study and preparing a report to recommend an effective global architecture for recognizing and mitigating the threat of epidemic infectious diseases. While our report focuses on the preparedness and response to these infectious disease threats, we acknowledge that the implementation of our recommendations will also help address other global health concerns such as the increasing appearance and spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). For instance, the strengthening of surveillance systems and laboratory capacity that will help us be better prepared to respond to infectious disease outbreaks, will also facilitate early identification and actions to prevent further transmission of a resistant strain.\n\nThe complete statement of task is provided in Box 1-1. Four Institute of Medicine (IOM) workshops were held on the following topic domains to provide input for the Commission's final report: 1. Governance for global health, 2. Financing response to pandemic threats, 3. Resilient health systems, and 4. Research and development of medical products.\n\nThe Commission was asked to consider the evidence supplied by these four workshops, as well as literature already published on lessons learned from the recent Ebola outbreak and other outbreaks of global impact. It is important to note that the charge of this Commission was not to provide a comprehensive analysis of the lessons learned drawn from the recent Ebola outbreak, but to draw on previous work to develop an understanding of common lessons learned from different previous in-\n\nBOX 1-1 Commission on Creating a Global Health Risk Framework for the Future\n\nStatement of Task\n\nAn international, independent, multi-stakeholder expert commission will conduct a study and prepare a report to recommend an effective global architecture for recognizing and mitigating the threat of epidemic infectious diseases. The commission will receive input from four Institute of Medicine workshops that will be coordinated:\n\n1. Governance for global health, which will explore global, national, and local capabilities, to include those required by the International Health Regulations (2005), to facilitate the collective action of the governmental, intergovernmental, corporate, and nonprofit sectors as they contribute to preparedness and response; 2. Financing response to pandemic threats, which will encompass public and private sector roles in financing preparedness, and response to epidemics. Financing mechanisms for public health surveillance, workforce mobilization and acquisition of medical commodities that can channel funds swiftly while minimizing transaction times and other expenses will be discussed; 3. Resilient health systems, which will include integrated surveillance and health information systems; workforce capacity; health system infrastructure; community, regional, and global partner engagement; and supply chain coordination and management; and 4. Research and development of medical products, which will assess the current product development platforms; explore incentives and infrastructure for product development, and conditions and needs for effective public-private partnerships; and address standards and approaches for regulatory harmonization and systems capacity.\n\nThe commission will consider the evidence supplied by these four workshops and the literature published on lessons learned on the current Ebola outbreak and other outbreaks of global impact such as H1N1 influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The commission will deliberate and evaluate options in these four domains to strengthen global, regional, national, and local systems to better prepare, detect, and respond to epidemic infectious diseases. Interrelations among sectors will be studied. Conclusions and actionable recommendations will be offered to guide policy makers, international funders, civil society organizations, and the private sector, with the understanding that stakeholders may adapt and apply the recommended architecture to global health emergencies beyond epidemic infectious diseases. In an effort to minimize overlap and maximize synergy, the commission will coordinate as possible with other global initiatives that are developing recommendations for improving the response to future global public health threats.\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY12 fectious disease outbreaks to inform the Commission's recommendations. We strived to identify those lessons learned that could help us develop a framework that can effectively address future known or unknown infectious disease threats. Summaries of four IOM workshops developed to gather evidence for this study (as described later in this chapter) were published in January 2016 (see nam.edu/GHRF for more information). These summaries compile the experiences related to issues of health systems, governance, finance, and research and development as shared by participants including those from the recent Ebola outbreak.\n\nThe statement of task required that the Commission deliberate and evaluate options in these four topic domains to strengthen global, regional, national, and local systems to better prepare, detect, and respond to epidemic infectious diseases. The Commission was charged with offering conclusions and actionable recommenda- tions to guide policy makers, international funders, civil society organizations, and the private sector.\n\nSTRUCTURE OF INITIATIVE\n\nThe initiative comprises an International Oversight Group (IOG), an independent Commission, and four IOM workshops that provided evidence to the Commission (see Figure 1-1).\n\nInternational Oversight Group\n\nThe IOG, a body of leaders representing various stakeholders with relevant expertise and global representation, was formed to ensure the independence and objectivity of the Commission, and to protect integrity and maintain public confidence in the process. The IOG steered the Commission throughout the process, including by creating the charge to the Commission, approving the slate of Commissioners, guiding report review, and as- sisting in the dissemination process. The IOG was tasked to: 1. Determine the scope of the study: In preparation for this study, NAM staffworked with sponsors and technical advisors to develop a formal statement of task, which defined and bounded the scope of the study and the balance of perspectives needed on the Commission. The IOG reviewed the proposed statement of task to ensure that the task reflected the current global need for such a framework and made refinements as needed. 2. Approve the Commission slate: The NAM received and reviewed more than 150 nominations for commissioners. Commissioners were proposed for service based on their expertise, geographic representation, and availability to perform the task. The IOG assessed whether the expertise required was present in the slate proposed and evaluated the overall composition of the Commission in terms of different experiences and perspectives. The IOG also defined what constituted a conflict of interest and if its presence should prevent an individual from serving on the Commission. In addition, the IOG determined whether a conflict of interest was unavoidable and how it should be handled. A primary goal of this process was to ensure that Commissioners' points of view were balanced so that the Commission could carry out its charge objectively and credibly. 3. Approve the Commission process for meetings, information gathering, deliberations, and report drafting: The IOG approved the Commission's approach as outlined in the following section. 4. Provide guidelines for the report review process: As a final check on the quality and objectivity of the study, the IOG determined the characteristics of the external review process for the final report and provided suggestions for specific processes. The review process was structured to ensure that the report addressed its approved study charge and did not go beyond it, that the findings were supported by the scientific evidence and arguments presented, that the exposition and organization were effective, and that the report was impartial and objective. The IOG did not review the report draft or provide comments on the report conclusions or recommendations.\n\n5. Assist with the development of a dissemination strategy: Dissemination of the final report is a key component for the success of this initiative. Therefore, the IOG assisted with identifying key decision makers and audiences, developing a dissemination strategy, and participating, if feasible, in its implementation.\n\nThe Commission\n\nThe Commission is made up of 17 experts drawn from different nations and representing a wide range of expertise, including governance; finance; disease control; surveillance; workforce mobilization; humanitarian and pandemic response; health systems; public-private partnerships; social science; and research, development, acqui sition, and distribution. The Commissioners were screened for conflicts of interest in order to ensure their independence.\n\nThe Commission held three meetings and one public session (see Appendix A) during the course of its work in 2015. At these meetings, Commissioners took time to understand their charge, considered evidence, and formed recommendations.\n\nThe Workstreams\n\nThe Commission's deliberations were based in large part on the evidence gathered and discussed at four IOM workshops in late 2015 (see Appendix B for workshop agendas): • August 5-7: A Workshop on Resilient and Sustain- able Health Systems to Respond to Global Infectious Disease Outbreaks, Accra, Ghana • August 19-21: A Workshop on Research and Development of Medical Products, Hong Kong, China • August 27-28: A Workshop on Pandemic Financing, Washington, DC, United States of America • September 1-2: Governance for Global Health-A Workshop, London, United Kingdom\n\nTo fulfill its statement of task in regard to financing response to pandemic threats, the Commission worked with two consultants. They provided technical expertise in pandemic financing and modeling the business case for investing in preparedness for global health events. The consultants communicated with Commissioners via\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY14 conference calls, and Commission deliberations determined how the consultants' analysis would be incorporated into the final recommendations.\n\nOther Sources of Information\n\nTwo consultation sessions were organized to complement workshop discussions and ensure that government, private-sector, civil society, and academia perspectives were captured: • September 25, 2015: Session with members of the U.S. federal government, Washington, DC • October 9, 2015: Webinar session with international and national representatives from multilateral organizations, academia, nonprofit, and private sector\n\nThe Commission also conducted consultations with WHO Director-General Margaret Chan on November 20, 2015, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Thomas Frieden on October 21, 2015, and World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim on November 12, 2015, to gather updated information about their respective organizations' current efforts on global health preparedness and response.\n\nIn addition to the workshops, Commission meetings, and consultations, the Commission conducted a literature review on infectious diseases, pandemics and pandemic risk, governance for health, finance, health systems, research and development, aid effectiveness, and existing global health frameworks, among other topics.\n\nCOORDINATION WITH OTHER INITIATIVES\n\nThe Commission also coordinated with many of the other global initiatives tasked with developing recommendations for improving the response to future global public health threats (see Table 1-1). It is important to note that, while some GHRF Commissioners contributed to other initiatives, this study preserved its high degree of independence and the integrity of its processes as outlined in this chapter.\n\nREVIEW PROCESS\n\nThis report has been reviewed in draft form by individuals chosen for their diverse perspectives and technical expertise. Reviewers were approved by the IOG.\n\nThe purpose of this independent review was to provide candid and critical comments that will assist the Commission in making its report as sound as possible and to ensure that the report meets standards for objectivity, evidence, and responsiveness to its charge. Reviewers were asked to consider whether in their judgment the evidence and arguments presented were sound and the report was fully responsive to the charge, not whether they concurred with the findings. The Commissioners were expected to consider all review comments and to provide written responses, which were evaluated by the review coordinator. The report was not released to the sponsors or the public, nor was it disclosed until after the review process was satisfactorily completed and all Commissioners approved the revised draft. Furthermore, once the review process was successfully completed, no changes (other than minor editorial emendations) were made to the approved text. The review comments and draft manuscript remain confidential to protect the integrity of the deliberative process.\n\nOVERVIEW OF THE REPORT\n\nThe remainder of this report is organized as follows: • Chapter 2 builds the case for a greater investment in pandemic preparedness. • Chapter 3 discusses the importance of national pub- lic health systems, including the need for objective and transparent assessment of national core capacities, for building and sustaining strong health systems, and for engaging and communicating with communities. • Chapter 4 reviews the need to strengthen international capabilities for outbreak preparedness, alert, and response, including the role and responsibilities of WHO, coordination among global actors, a revamp of processes and protocols, and mobilization of global financial resources. • Chapter 5 presents the importance of accelerating medical products research and development to counter the threat of infectious diseases and outlines a global strategy to facilitate this-including a plan to develop a Pandemic Product Development Committee, invest in a comprehensive portfolio of medical products, conduct research according to high scientific standards, and secure overarching global agreements.\n\n• Chapter 6 reviews the steps necessary for building a framework for global health security and overcoming the associated financial challenges.\n\nGHSA (Global Health Security Agenda). 2015. https://ghsagenda. j20.org (accessed February 1, 2016).

There are also very few risks that have greater potential for catastrophic economic impact-potentially on the scale of a global financial crisis-but the measures we are taking to avoid another financial crisis are of an entirely different magnitude.1\n\nThe costs of significantly upgrading the world's defenses against pandemics, while substantial, are not out of reach. The recent Ebola outbreak revealed many gaps and shortcomings in preparedness and the ability to respond effectively at both the national and global levels. These flaws in our defenses cost thousands of lives and meant that the ultimate cost of preventing Ebola from becoming a pandemic was much higher than it may otherwise have been. Ebola also demonstrated that being better prepared has huge benefits. For example, Nigeria contained the virus successfully, despite being a densely populated nation with many health and social challenges.\n\nThe Commission believes that commitment of an incremental $4.5 billion2 per year would make the world much safer. This figure includes expenditures for strengthening national public health systems; funding research and development; and financing global coordi-\n\nThis section draws on \"Modeling the Economic Threat of Pandemics\" by Anas El Turabi and Philip Saynisch (see Appendix C). 2 All monetary figures in U.S. dollars. 1 nation and contingency efforts, all of which are explored in greater detail in subsequent chapters. While it may be beneficial to spend more, investing at least this much would address the most urgent weaknesses in global health security. In addition to shoring up our defenses against pandemics, this investment would also yield enormous benefits in protecting the world against other health risks, such as antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and bioterrorism.\n\nHow does $4.5 billion per year stack up against the potential risks? The 1918 influenza pandemic killed approximately 50 million people (CDC, 2014) and arguably as high as 100 million in 1918-1920 ( Johnson and Mueller, 2002). As a driver of incremental mortality in the last century, few other events even compare: total deaths from World War II are estimated to be between 35 and 60 million,3 and HIV/AIDS has killed nearly 40 million people since the start of the epidemic (UNAIDS, 2014). Moreover, despite enormous advances in medicine and scientific understanding, and the containment of recent pandemic threats such as severe actue respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1 influenza, and, eventually, Ebola, we should not be complacent about future risks. The consensus among leading epidemiologists and public health experts is the threat from infectious diseases is growing. Emerging infectious disease events are increasing significantly over time ( Jones, 2008), and, with an Encyclopaedia Britannica, 15th ed., s.vv. \"World Wars.\" 3\n\nThe global community has massively underestimated the risks that pandemics present to human life and livelihoods, at least in terms of policy outcomes. The resources devoted to preventing and responding to such threats seem wholly inadequate to the scale of the risk. While it is impossible to produce precise estimates for the probability and potential impact of pandemics, it is not difficult to demonstrate a compelling case for greater investment. There are very few risks facing humankind that threaten loss of life on the scale of pandemics.\n\nThe Case for Investing in Pandemic Preparedness 2\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY18 ever-increasing global population, greater consumption of meat, and continuing increases in mobility and connectivity, the conditions for infectious disease emergence and contagion are more dangerous than ever. $4.5 billion annually equates to just 65 cents per person; with such a modest investment, we could better protect everyone in the world from such risks.\n\nFrom an economic perspective, the argument is equally compelling. The World Bank has estimated the economic impact of a severe pandemic (that is, one on the scale of the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919) at nearly 5 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP), or roughly $3 trillion (Jonas, 2014). Some might see this as an exaggeration, but it could also be an underestimate. Aggregate cumulative GDP losses for Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone in 2014 and 2015 are estimated to amount to more than 10 percent (UNDG, 2015; World Bank, 2014). This huge cost is the result of an epidemic that, for all its horror, infected only about 0.25 percent of the population of Liberia, roughly 0.25 percent of the population of Sierra Leone, and less than 0.05 percent of the population of Guinea (WHO, 2016), with approximately 11,300 total deaths (CDC, 2016). The Commission's own scenario modeling, based on the World Bank parameters, suggests that during the 21st century global pandemics could cost in excess of $6 trillion, with an expected loss of more than $60 billion per year (see Appendix C).4\n\nThe expected loss refers to the amount that the global economy will 4\n\nIndeed, the economic impact of infectious diseases appears to be increasing as greater human and economic connectedness-whether through transnational supply chains, increased travel, or ubiquitous access to communication technologies and media-fuel contagion, both of the virus itself and of fear. Most of the economic impact of pandemics stems not from mortality but from behavioral change, as people seek to avoid infection (Burns et al., 2008). This behavioral change is driven by fear, which in turn is driven by a potent mix of awareness and ignorance. As Poincaré noted with respect to the plague, \"the plague was nothing; fear of the plague was much more formidable\" (Poincaré, 1905). The experience of SARS is instructive: viewed from the perspective of overall mortality, SARS infected \"only\" 8,000 people and killed less than 800 (WHO, 2003). Yet the economic cost of SARS has been estimated at more than $40 billion (Lee and McKibbin, 2004). At the peak of SARS, Hong Kong saw an 80 percent reduction in air traffic (Lee and McKibbin, 2004) and a 50 percent reduction in retail sales (Siu and Wong, 2004).\n\nOne reason that pandemics are so hard to predict, and their costs so hard to estimate, is that they are not discrete events, but represent the extreme end of a spectrum of infectious disease risks (see Figure 2-1). New infectious diseases emerge annually. Outbreaks, both of new infectious lose each year of the century, on average. It is calculated by multiplying the probability of a loss occurring in any year by the size of the loss. diseases and of known pathogens, occur many times every year. A small proportion of such outbreaks evolves into epidemics; others are contained, eradicated, or become endemic. An even smaller proportion of epidemics turns into pandemics. Therefore, pandemic risk should not be seen in isolation, but rather as part of a spectrum of escalating disease events, with both costs and potential for mitigation across the entire spectrum.\n\nViewed from this perspective, the task for policy makers is not just to reduce the likelihood and cost of pandemics as extreme right-tail events, but to reduce the economic and human costs across the whole spectrum of infectious disease threats. We should not become fixated on the probability of a \"once-in-a-100-years\" pandemic of the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic of severity. Much less virulent pandemics can still cause significant loss of life and economic impact. The influenza pandemics of 1958 and 1968, while far less deadly than the one in 1918-1919, are estimated to have cost 3.1 percent and 0.7 percent of global GDP, respectively (McKibbin and Sidorenko, 2006). Potential pandemics, that is outbreaks or epidemics that could become pandemics if not effectively contained, can also have enormous impact. Ebola, an epidemic that looked as if might have the potential to become a pandemic, has killed more than 11,000 people (CDC, 2016) and cost more than $2 billion (World Bank, 2014). While there is a high degree of uncertainty, the Commission's own modeling suggests that we are more likely than not to see at least one pandemic over the next 100 years, and there is at least a 20 percent chance of seeing four or more (see Appendix C).\n\nFramed in this way, the investment case for pandemic preparedness and response rests not just on the probability and costs attached to a severe pandemic, but also on the likely costs to human lives and livelihoods across the spectrum of infectious disease threats. The apparent acceleration in the emergence of new infectious diseases underscores the need for a \"One Health\" approach, which recognizes the connection of human health to animal and plant health. Further outbreaks of new, dormant, or even well-known diseases are a certainty. More epidemics with the potential to become pandemics should be anticipated.\n\nAmong the known threats are multiple strains of influenza, coronaviruses, and vector-borne diseases- headlined by malaria but also including other endemic conditions that are still spreading because of climate change among other reasons. There is also always the possibility of re-emerging or completely new zoonotic viruses, or of different kinds of infectious threats, such as fungal infections, particularly in the context of growing AMR. Such potential pandemics are perhaps more frequent than is recognized; in the past 15 years, we have faced at least five: SARS, H5N1, H1N1, Ebola, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).\n\nSo, even if we downplay the likelihood of a catastrophic pandemic-and this would certainly be a mistake-there is a powerful case for investing more to minimize the frequency and mitigate the impact of potential pandemics. We appear to have been successful in preventing Ebola from becoming a pandemic, but at far greater cost in terms of lives and dollars than would have been necessary had we been better prepared.\n\nGiven the degree of uncertainty in this arena, it also makes sense to think about the relative costs of error-of investing too much or investing too little. If we overinvest, we will have upgraded primary health care and public health systems more than merited by the pandemic threat alone and spent more on vaccine and diagnostic research than strictly necessary. Yet it is hard to see this as wasted money. The core capabilities of primary care and public health systems are crucial to achieving many other health objectives. For example, reinforcing disease surveillance and response capabilities will have benefits for the management and treatment of endemic diseases, such as tuberculosis and malaria, which themselves cause significant loss of life and economic harm. Tuberculosis affects 8.5 million globally each year, reducing labor productivity by about 30 percent and reducing global GDP by about $12 billion per year (Fonkwo, 2008). Malaria affects approximately 150 million people each year (Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 Collaborators, 2015), and is estimated to reduce GDP for sub-Saharan African countries by some 10 percent (Sachs and Malaney, 2002). Such investments in the foundations of national health systems would also play a role in mitigating the threats to health security from noncommunicable diseases (Heymann et al., 2015). On the other hand, if we invest too little, we open the door to potential disaster.\n\nThe investment case for reinforcing global capabilities, rather than simply each country's own preparedness, does not depend on altruism, although such a moral argument clearly exists. To make themselves safer, rich countries must help the poorer parts of the world, because\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY20 global health security is truly a public good. Zoonotic transfers and outbreaks in even the poorest parts of the world can have global impact, as both HIV/AIDS and Ebola demonstrate.\n\nIt is instructive to take pandemics out of the medical context and think about the threat as a national security issue. For any one country, a pandemic is a threat that could kill hundreds and thousands every few years-and might potentially kill millions. Yet in most countries it attracts a small fraction of the resources devoted to national defense. Global military spending amounts to more than $2 trillion (CIA, 2015); many countries participate in highly structured and well-resourced international alliances, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO); and most countries regularly conduct exercises to test preparedness and response. As Bill Gates has pointed out, the contrast with the small amount of resources devoted to protecting humankind from potential pandemics is striking (Gates, 2015).\n\nIt is equally illuminating to consider pandemics as an economic risk. Despite the compelling evidence of the disruption caused by potential pandemics, their threat to economic stability typically receives very little attention from economic policy makers at either the national or international levels, and even fewer resources. Since the global financial crisis of 2008, policy makers have forced banks to dramatically increase their capital levels as a protection against future crisis, the cost of which is ultimately borne by society as a whole, through lower returns on equity or higher costs of credit. Consider the new total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) rule, which applies only to the 27 largest banks in the world. The direct costs of this rule are estimated at $17 billion, and the resulting higher credit spreads are expected to cost approximately $20 billion in reduced GDP growth. This single component of the investment in preventing a future financial crisis dwarfs our Commission's proposed spending on pandemic risk (BIS, 2015).\n\nOur point is not to argue that we spend too much or too little on other threats to security or economic stability, but rather to highlight out how relatively little we invest to protect the world from the threat of infectious diseases. One truth that holds across many different types of potentially catastrophic risks, including pandemics, is that prevention is far more cost-effective than response, and that the most effective response is a well-prepared response. In other words, spending money now will save money and lives later.\n\nRecommendations: The G7, G20, and United Nations (UN), under the leadership of the UN Secretary General, should reinforce and sustain international focus and actions to protect human lives and livelihoods from the threat of infectious diseases by:\n\nBIS (Bank for International Settlements). 2015.

Indeed, some would argue that public health and primary care are so interdependent and interlinked that talking about them as separate functions is counter-productive. Others would argue in favor of the distinction, because (a) primary care, as part of the health care system, is fundamentally patient-centered, whereas public health is focused on population health; and (b) some public health investments (e.g., laboratories, epidemiologists, health educators, etc.) are quite distinct from those of primary care and are often neglected. Whichever view one takes, both sets of capabilities and infrastructure are necessary to prepare and respond to the threat of infectious diseases. A primary health care system without the support of strong public health capabilities will lack the ability to monitor disease patterns and be unable to plan and mobilize the scale of response required to contain an outbreak. A public health system without strong primary care capabilities will lack both the \"radar screen\" to pick up the initial cases of an outbreak and the delivery system to execute an effective response strategy. In the context of countering the threat of infectious diseases, public health and primary care serve the same ultimate objective-improving the health security of individuals. Public health approaches this challenge from the macro level by looking at the health security of the population, cascading from the national level down to the community level. Primary care approaches the challenge from the perspective of providing clinical care to individual patients at the local community level. In this chapter, we will focus on public health systems with the recognition that even countries with highly developed economies and sophisticated health systems have failed to invest in the infrastructure and capabilities necessary to provide essential public health services. Investment in public health is often hard to justify against other priorities, including other health priorities, because the achievements of good public health often take the form of crises averted and are therefore invisible. It takes a disaster like the recent Ebola outbreak to demonstrate the critical importance of this often unsung component of the health system. Public health capacities at regional and international levels are also important, but national capacities are the foundation of an effective global health risk framework. Regional and global capabilities cannot compensate for deficiencies at the national or local level. Systemic deficiencies in national public health systems, especially the lack of functional disease surveillance and response systems, were key contributors to the length and severity of the Ebola outbreaks in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone (Kieny et al., 2014). And this is not a problem unique to low-income nations. Recent outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) demonstrated that even advanced economies are often unprepared to deliver an effective and timely response to public health emergencies.\n\nNational public health systems are essential components of resilient health systems and the first line of defense against the threat of pandemic disease. Robust public health capabilities and infrastructure at a national level are thus the foundation of a global health risk framework. We acknowledge that public health cannot be considered in isolation.\n\nStrengthening Public Health as the Foundation of 3 the Health System and First Line of Defense\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY24\n\nEvery national government must therefore take responsibility for building an effective public health system and be prepared to be held accountable, both by its own people and, given the externalities, by the international community. Indeed, the importance of national core capacities has been recognized by some individual governments and by the international community, as reflected in the 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR), which establish health security as a global public good (WHO, 2008a). Yet despite widespread agreement on the importance of public health, the global community has failed to deliver. Although countries like Uganda, which has contained several outbreaks of Ebola in the past 10 years, have demonstrated that even relatively poor countries can create effective public health systems, most countries fail against IHR according to even their own self-assessments (WHO, 2015c). Independent, objective assessments would undoubtedly paint an even darker picture.\n\nThe Commission believes it is imperative to turn fine words into action. Deficiencies in public health systems need to be identified and resolved. National governments must commit to rapid reinforcement of their public health core capacities. Public health should be treated as an integral part of national security-part of a government's fundamental duty to protect its own people. To force the pace and ensure accountability, we need (1) clarity on the core capacities required and definition of clear benchmarks; (2) objective, independent, and transparent assessment of a country's performance against these benchmarks to identify gaps; (3) clear national plans to achieve and sustain these benchmarks, including resourcing; (4) mobilization of resources at a national level, as well as through the international community to fill gaps and sustain benchmark core capacities; and (5) strategies to support minimum standards in fragile and failed states.\n\nDESPITE SOME IMPROVEMENTS, MANY COUNTRIES HAVE FAILED TO BUILD THE NECESSARY PUBLIC HEALTH CAPACITIES\n\nThe importance of building strong public health systems was globally recognized following the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003 (GAO, 2004) and the emergence of avian influenza H5N1 in 2003-2004 (FAO and OIE, 2008). These outbreaks exposed weaknesses in detection, reporting, and response similar to deficiencies revealed by the Ebola outbreak. In response, the World Health Organiza tion (WHO) member states agreed to implement the 2005 revisions of the IHR, committing to develop core capacities for detection, assessment, notification, and reporting of events to respond to public health risks and emergencies (WHO, 2008a) (see Table 3-1). This binding agreement also emphasizes the importance of containing emergencies locally.\n\nOne of the changes made to the original IHR when they were renewed in 2005 was the addition of a decision instrument to help national authorities determine whether a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) should be reported to WHO. The new instrument replaced a fixed list of specific diseases to report that failed to account for new or unknown threats. Since 2005, WHO has declared a PHEIC three times: the first in 2009 for the H1N1 pandemic; the other two in 2014 for polio and Ebola. H1N1 marked the first time the IHR (2005) were put to the test-and, once again, fragilities in national- and international-level response capacities were exposed, leading to doubts about the IHR mechanism itself.\n\nTo address concerns arising from the H1N1 response, WHO's Executive Board resolved in January 2010 to constitute a Review Committee with three key objectives (WHO, 2010): 1. assess the functioning of the IHR; 2. assess the ongoing global response to H1N1 (in- cluding the role of WHO); and 3. identify lessons learned to strengthen preparedness and response to future pandemics and public health emergencies.\n\nThe Review Committee, chaired by Harvey Fineberg (then president of the Institute of Medicine [IOM]), submitted its report to WHO in 2011, putting forth 3 overarching conclusions and 15 recommendations (WHO, 2011b). The report observed that core national and local capacities as required in the IHR were not operational in more than half the affected countries, with many lacking the ability to detect, assess, and report potential health threats. It also noted the lack of pathways for countries to ensure timely implementation of the requirements of the IHR. In order to accelerate the implementation of core capacities introduced in the IHR, WHO developed a guide to support countries in assessment and planning.\n\nWHO described in this document a range of activities to advocate for IHR implementation, mobilize resources, and monitor implementation plans (WHO, 2013). According to self-assessments by member countries for the years 2013 and 2014 (see Table 3-1 in Annex 3-1), overall improvement over the previous year was limited under several indicators. These assessments also provide further insight into the overall lack of health system capacity, especially in terms of preparedness, human resource capacity, and at points of entry (which includes ports, airports, and ground crossings), with countries in the African region reporting the lowest compliance. Despite some progress, 67 percent of countries self-assessed themselves as not being fully compliant with the IHR (WHO, 2015c). ROBUST PUBLIC HEALTH CAPACITIES ARE ACHIEVABLE IN THE CONTEXT OF BUILDING AND SUSTAINING STRONG HEALTH SYSTEMS Before the current West African Ebola outbreak, Uganda was the site of the largest Ebola outbreak in history, with\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY26 reported cases in 2000 (CDC, 2001). Yet the outcome of this outbreak was distinctly more positive, because Uganda had in place an operational national health policy and strategic plan, an essential health services package that included disease surveillance and control, and a decentralized health delivery system (Mbonye et al., 2014). After 2000, Uganda's leadership realized that, despite the successful containment of the outbreak, a focus on strengthening surveillance and response capacities at each level of the national system would greatly improve the country's ability to respond to future threats (Aceng, 2015). Uganda has since suffered four additional Ebola outbreaks (CDC, 2014b), as well as one outbreak of Marburg hemorrhagic fever. However, due to its new approach, Uganda was able to markedly improve its detection and response to these public health emergencies (see Table 3-2). 425\n\nThe success of the Ugandan experience is founded in a deep political commitment to strengthen core capacities despite limited resources. The key elements of the strategy implemented in Uganda are described in Annex 3-2.\n\nTo build strong public health capacities that will allow detection, reporting, and response to infectious disease threats, countries should focus on revising public health law frameworks, strengthening public health infrastructure; building partnerships; using research evidence to inform program and policy decisions; engaging and improving communication with communities; and establishing a public health emergency operations center (PHEOC) (see Box 3-1).\n\nAn alternative, but essentially equivalent, blueprint for reinforcing public health capacities is embodied in the 11 \"action packages\" set forth in the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA).1 This multi-national initiative was launched in 2014, linking several member states, international organizations, and civil society together to For more information, see https://ghsagenda.org (accessed April 1, 2016). 1 prioritize health security activities and help countries to achieve core capacities of the IHR. The GHSA seeks to achieve coordinated action and undertake specific, measurable steps to prevent, detect, and respond quickly to emerging infectious diseases. To facilitate this goal, the 11 action packages provide guidance in areas ranging from prevention to detection to response (see Table 3-3). These packages include baseline assessments, planning activities, and monitoring and evaluation activities that break down the broad issues of global health security into more discrete and attainable goals. As of April 2015, 44 countries had signed on to at least 1 of the 11 action packages with a 5-year target goal, either committing themselves to meet core capacity criteria or assisting another country in need (IOM, 2015). For each action package, there are designated lead and contributing countries that will work together (Katz et al., 2015).\n\nIn addition to the country commitments for action packages, a peer assessment initiative began in 2015, with five countries, including Uganda, acting as pilots to measure their progress against each action package.2 This process is separate from the IHR assessment, which is carried out by a country individually or in collaboration with a WHO regional office. Although the IHR assessment is a required part of the regulations, there is no system to hold countries accountable, and no penalty for abstaining.\n\nIn addition to the five countries that participated in 2015, several have committed to the GHSA assessment process for 2016. Important lessons can be learned from this initiative and the experience gathered from its pilot assessments. For instance, unlike the IHR, the GHSA addresses the importance of having a functional national vaccine delivery system that can be quickly adapted to new disease threats. Action package \"Prevent 4\" (see Table 3-3) sets a 5-year target of 90 percent coverage of For more information on the pilots, see http://www.cdc.gov/ globalhealth/security (accessed April 1, 2016). 2\n\nYear Response Timeline Number of Cases Number of Deaths\n\n2000 38 days from first known case to preliminary investigation 425 224\n\n2007 75 days from first known case to preliminary investigation 146 39\n\n2011 1 day between case confirmation and response 1 1\n\n2012 2 days between laboratory confirmation and response 24 17\n\nTABLE 3-2 Ebola Outbreaks in Uganda SOURCE: Aceng, 2015. a country's 15-month-old population with at least 1 dose of measles vaccine (CDC, 2014a). This target was chosen because measles vaccination serves as a proxy indicator for the overall status of coverage for vaccine preventable diseases. A system to deliver vaccines nationwide safely and effectively is an essential component of an outbreak response plan.\n\nRevising Public Health Law/Policy Frameworks3\n\nAlthough there are many technical and resourcing challenges in building stronger public health systems, in many countries the fundamental impediments revolve around political commitment and governance. Government leaders need to recognize the importance of the overall health system, and public health in particular, to the nation's human and economic security, and to translate this recognition into budget priorities and concrete plans. Sustained political commitment at the highest levels is essential to devise policies and pass legislation to facilitate the implementation of core capacities, including establishment of national focal points (NFPs), development of laboratory networks and surveillance systems, and provision of adequate financial resources.\n\nFailures of governance, most notably the flourishing of corruption, can be fatal to such efforts, diverting resources and distorting priorities. Of course, corruption and governance weaknesses are a problem for not only public health, but also every aspect of public services. Yet, given the level of governmental commitment required to build resilient health systems with adequate public health capabilities and infrastructure, this arena For the purposes of this discussion, we use the framework set out in Box 3-1. 3 seems particularly vulnerable to such failures. Addressing the challenge of corruption is beyond the mandate of this Commission, but we recognize the reality of the problem. Civil society organizations, both local and international, as well as the international community, have critical roles to play in holding governments accountable, pressing for improvements in governance, and eradicating corruption.\n\nStrengthening Public Health Infrastructure and Capabilities Outbreaks cannot be effectively contained if they are not detected promptly. National public health systems must have the capacity to identify an outbreak and establish an alert system to trigger response and, if needed, seek support from regional and global levels. Countries should work to develop real-time detection and response systems, prioritizing elements that reinforce prevention, provide early detection, and enable effective response. Plans to reinforce public health infrastructure and capabilities will need to combine tactical actions delivering short-term improvements with more strategic initiatives to build capacity over the longer term.\n\nPublic Health Workforce\n\nWithout a skilled, motivated, and well-supported health workforce, no health system can achieve its goals. Yet the world faces a global health workforce crisis- characterized by widespread shortages of skilled personnel, uneven distribution of skills, and, in many situations, poor working conditions (Campbell et al., 2013; WHO, 2006). Many countries lack relevant skills in a range of disciplines essential to public health, including epidemiology, biological and health sciences, veterinary\n\nBOX 3-1 Actions to Build Strong Public Health Systems 1.

Establish a Public Health Emergency Operations Center SOURCE: Adapted from IOM, 2003.\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY28 science, psychology, anthropology, and biostatistics. Outbreak planning requires skills outside the medical arena, such as logistics, security, and communications. Building workforce capacity to sustain an effective and responsive public health system is one of the most profound health challenges for many countries. Therefore, countries should commit to developing and implementing a workforce-strengthening strategy and plan that includes training programs for public and veterinary health professionals. Countries should also expand existing initiatives, such as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Field Epidemiology Training Programs (FETPs), which are already being implemented in several countries. Public health workforce strengthening should occur at the community, district, and other subnational levels and through the establishment of national networks to share critical resources and knowledge across public, private, and nonprofit sectors. Countries should also strive to link with regional and global networks to share resources and best practices, participate in training exercises, and collaborate on research studies.\n\nDisease Surveillance and Information Systems Effective surveillance is critical to containing infectious disease outbreaks. Disease surveillance and health information systems should be developed with the long-term vision of creating nationwide, interoperable, and interconnected platforms that are capable of collecting, aggregating, and analyzing information at every level of the health system (community, district, other subnational, and national levels). Such systems should be able to support both indicator-based (syndromic) surveillance and event-based surveillance. Increased access to new information technology has increased surveillance capacity even in countries with limited resources and should be fully exploited (IOM, 2007). Electronic surveillance tools should be implemented and standardized across the country to transmit information to a central hub that can be accessed in real-time by surveillance staff at every level. For instance, the common use of mobile phones has allowed early detection and response to outbreaks in remote areas (Rosewell et al., 2013).\n\nSurveillance data should be collected in a way that allows integration with data coming from other health and non-health sources, which facilitates the decisionmaking process by confirming or providing more detail on a specific event. Therefore, countries should avoid the creation of parallel systems, instead seeking to ensure interoperability between existing and new systems. Continuous training is essential, and training guidelines and materials should be updated regularly based on changing needs and priorities.\n\nStrengthening disease surveillance systems would allow countries to comply with IHR requirements and report the occurrence of a PHEIC within 24 hours of receiving indicatory information. Country surveillance guidelines should include procedures and reporting templates to comply with these obligations.\n\nLaboratory Capacity\n\nAn effective nationwide laboratory network is another key component of a highly-functioning public health system. Such a network needs to be able to systematically identify, collect, and transport specimens to labo- ratories with adequate equipment and personnel to carry out reliable testing. Diagnostic capacity should be developed for at least a core list of pathogens (based on the country's major public health risks). A tiered network should be integrated with the disease surveillance system at every level of the health care system to ensure that information reaches decision makers quickly. Collaboration and communication between human and animal laboratory systems is also vital.\n\nTechnological innovation promises more costeffective and rapid diagnostics. However, it also requires trained biomedical engineers-a scarce resource that is critical to the functioning and integrity of a high-quality laboratory network. Development partners, who provide training, offer technical support for accreditation processes, and aid in the acquisition and maintenance of laboratory equipment, have been essential in resourcelimited countries. Community involvement has been equally important in disease surveillance and transportation of laboratory sample efforts, as shown by the experience in Uganda (see Annex 3-2).\n\nCountries should ensure that adequate diagnostic capacity is available either within the country (within the public or private sector), or via a collaboration mechanism established at the regional or global level. To facilitate outbreak response, a catalog of laboratory resources should be developed and made available across the health sector and other sectors involved. Progress at this level will require, as mentioned earlier, the development of national plans for diagnostic approaches that include protocols to handle specimens and apply diagnostic tests. Evaluation against predetermined performance targets is key to monitoring progress and guiding improvement.\n\nBuilding Partnerships\n\nGovernment public health agencies are the cornerstones of the public health system, but they cannot work in isolation. To deliver an adequate response during outbreaks, they need to build and maintain partnerships with other public, private, and nonprofit sectors and work closely with communities and community-based organizations.\n\nWithin the Health Sector\n\nCountries should make the most of available resources by analyzing the strengths, needs, and challenges of existing systems and avoiding creation of parallel structures. There are already too many examples of vertical inter- ventions in health systems that fail to strengthen the system as a whole (Atun et al., 2008). Effective integration of health care delivery and public health is essential, because outbreaks are typically first detected through primary health care, and because the health care delivery system is critical to executing a response strategy. Such integration must include both public and private health care delivery systems, which play a large role in many countries, because the first (or \"index\") case in a potential epidemic could be seen first in either system, or could move between them. For example, the first human cases of H5N1 in Laos (Puthavathana et al., 2009) and MERS in Thailand were seen by private hospitals (Schnirring, 2015). Similarly, the first cases of H1NI in Ghana and Ebola in Nigeria were discovered by private clinics ( Freeman, 2014).\n\nIt is also important that countries move toward institutionalization of a One Health approach, which integrates veterinary and agriculture practitioners with the public health system (Coker et al., 2011). Globally, a One Health approach has become well established, with the creation of the Global Early Warning System, a platform developed by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), WHO, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (UN) to improve early warning on animal diseases and zoonoses worldwide.4 The One Health approach is also an explicit component of the GHSA, embedded, for example, in the action packages on zoonotic diseases and laboratory networks.\n\nAcross Sectors\n\nEffective response to a potential pandemic requires deployment of a broad range of skills and assets beyond the health arena. Governments should therefore engage with key players in non-health sectors, such as private companies and civil society organizations, to establish clear communication and coordination at the national, subnational, and district levels. It is key to establish these mechanisms before the emergence of a health crisis.\n\nWorking with Development Partners\n\nNational governments must ensure that their partnerships with international development partners focus on national capacity building that prioritizes country See http://www.who.int/zoonoses/outbreaks/glews/en (accessed April 1, 2016). 4\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY30 owner ship and accountability for health systems based on national plans and aspirations. Development partners should, in turn, respect and support countries' ownership of health plans and priorities. (For more on country relationships with development partners, see the Rwanda case study in Annex 3-3.)\n\nWorking at the Regional Level\n\nNational governments should also foster regional approaches to complement country-level efforts, as regional strategies have proved to be an efficient way to address limitations in national resources and skills and bring an element of cultural competency and epidemiological familiarity. Regional initiatives also build trust across professional communities, thereby facilitating communication in times of crisis. The Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance Network, which was established in 2000, is an example of regional collaboration among six countries in Southeast Asia. With a semiformal friendship- and trust-based relationship, the network enables cross-border collaboration and, most importantly, \"joint outbreak investigation and control\" when outbreaks occur along the border (Phommasack et al., 2013).\n\nRegional capacity should also be built through the expansion of efforts such as the CDC's FETP, the creation of professional registries, the establishment of laboratory networks, regional mutual assistance agreements, and regional preparedness exercises. WHO regional offices have a key role to play at this level, facilitating coordination between regional health players and supporting regional initiatives.\n\nUsing Research Evidence to Inform Program and Policy Decisions\n\nHealth systems research is a core function of a learning health system that can continuously assess performance and identify responsive solutions. Lack of capacity for health systems research is a major weakness in many low-income countries (Decoster et al., 2012). Each country should have research capacity built into its health system planning and budget. Social sciences research would help public health leaders understand the social, behavioral, and anthropological aspects of disease preparedness and response, such as effective strategies to engage communities in outbreak detection and control and communicate threats and required responses. The recent Ebola outbreak clearly illustrated the importance of robust representative studies on knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding Ebola to inform policies and development of effective communication strategies (Laverack and Manoncourt, 2015).\n\nEngaging and Communicating with Communities\n\nEpidemics are shaped by a range of factors that include multiple socio-cultural and economic dimensions. Public health practitioners and policy makers cannot succeed in their endeavors to prevent or respond to infectious disease threats without working closely with communities. Considerable \"buy in\" and support is essential, as little can be achieved if people are unwilling to accept vaccinations or to consume medications. Public health programs requiring collective behavioral change to interrupt the transmission of infectious disease need the active support and involvement of the communities they wish to assist. Indeed, there are many cautionary cases of communities rejecting public health interventions, sometimes in violent ways. The deaths of several health workers and journalists during the outbreak of Ebola in Guinea in September 2014 are a tragic illustration of extreme negative responses to public health interventions.\n\nPublic trust and confidence is a precondition for successfully preventing and containing outbreaks and epidemics. Yet trust can be extremely difficult to build where corruption or other governance failures are prevalent. Where health systems are weak and people question the motives underpinning messages promoting healthy behaviors, public trust and confidence in the work of government and international agencies tend to be minimal, fragile, or absent. It is thus vital that time is taken to engage with, and learn from, local people in an open and flexible way. Such long-term, ongoing engagements not only help create the space for healthy social norms to be established, but also enable pathways that facilitate necessary coordination and mobilization in the event of an outbreak. The recent outbreaks of Ebola in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone illustrate this point. Doubt, fear, and distrust informed many local people's responses to interventions proposed by governments and international agencies (Dhillon et al., 2015). In some places, this contributed to, and exacerbated, the transmission of the virus (MSF, 2014), while simultaneously reinforcing preexisting distrust in health authorities.\n\nIt is also important to acknowledge and celebrate positive outcomes from community engagement. In Uganda, for example, most outbreaks are detected through community surveillance systems in which influential community leaders are trained to alert village health teams as soon as they detect any unusual occurrences of death (Aceng, 2015). Ultimately, communities played a vital role in disease surveillance and implementation of countermeasures during the Ebola outbreak. Using a bottom-up approach, public health authorities were able to devise ways to influence deep-seated cultural practices and behaviors related to burial rites, caring for the sick, and social gatherings, which were key contributors to the mitigation or containment of the outbreak (Aceng, 2015). Box 3-2 offers guidance on how to engage communities before, during, and after infectious disease outbreaks. Community-based service providers (of health, education, and security, among others), local government officials, elected members, staffworking at local nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and anthropologists are well placed to liaise with local people. These professionals recognize the need to work with a range of influential people in many roles and understand the importance of developing trusting relationships. They also have many valuable skills, including fluency in the local language, as well as the willingness to talk, listen, and observe to acquire a thorough understanding of the range of perspectives that make up the local culture. Also essential is a willingness to let go of preconceived ideas and recognize that local people may well be able to come\n\nBOX 3-2 Engaging Communities for Outbreak Preparedness and Response\n\nBefore a Major Outbreak\n\nUseful methods to foster engagement include the following:\n\n• Regular meetings with local leaders to discuss aspects of infectious disease prevention and control (with staff from the national Ministry of Health being made aware of these meetings and contributing to them). • Influential leaders (including political leaders, village health care workers, and religious figures) could also be given training in public health practices and encouraged to report possible cases to nearby health facilities when cases emerge. • Communication campaigns (involving written and aural media) may also be effective ways to boost surveillance capacity.\n\nDuring an Outbreak\n\nCommunities can be very effective as the first line of surveillance, actively tracking down and reporting unusual events, as well as managing and containing outbreaks. Useful approaches include the following:\n\n• Responders could engage communities through mass meetings, community mapping exercises, training, and active case finding. In West Point, Liberia (Fallah, 2015), for example, community town hall meetings and \"foot soldiers\" usefully contributed to surveillance. • Harnessing local activism (e.g., identifying local community members to be activists, training them, and deploying them in the community) can help build ownership and responsibility among communities in containing outbreaks. • Space should be created to enable local leaders to take the lead in designing and developing communication campaigns and social mobilization efforts. • Great care should be taken to devise strategies enabling the most politically and economically marginal populations (who are vulnerable to infection and often systematically ignored) to be included. • Task-shifting and sharing with proper training could allow non-specialists to provide care (e.g., psychosocial support).\n\nAfter an Outbreak\n\nNothing is more damaging to trust than for government officials, international nongovernmental organizations, and multilateral donors to take no interest in the challenges facing communities in the wake of an outbreak or epidemic. Every effort should be made to maintain links, follow up on families affected by outbreaks, and to solicit feedback about serious issues. In the case of Ebola, for example, it is vital that efforts are made to monitor the long-term health and well-being of those who have survived, while also assessing the social and economic impact of the outbreak for those who have lost members of their family to the infection.\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY32 up with novel solutions to contain outbreaks and resolve complex public health issues. Anthropologists are well placed to identify deep sociocultural conditions that may impact the course of the overall epidemic and the response at multiple critical points; they should describe the practical relevance and applicability of their findings to facilitate acceptance and implementation of their recommendations (Abramowitz, 2014).\n\nEffective communication is a critical component of preparedness and response to outbreaks. Preventing and containing infectious disease presents particular challenges because options for interrupting transmission are often limited, and it is crucial that change occurs at speed. Therefore, communications should be approached as a progressive, adaptable process, rather than a monolith of simple messaging. Public health officials should develop contextspecific approaches that recognize the influence of history, culture, and social forces in their population. For more information about the influence of history in the response of the community to containment measures implemented during outbreaks of infectious diseases, see Annex 3-4. Social media offers promising tools to reach different groups with appropriate messaging. However, messaging must be carefully researched and framed for the context and cultural practices of the targeted audience. Simple, standardized messages grounded in a biomedical understanding of contagion can be ineffective if they ignore these factors. In fact, recent experiences in West Africa (Chandler et al., 2015), as well as in past outbreaks of Ebola in Uganda (Hewlett and Hewlett, 2008) show how oversimplified messaging can reinforce rumors and anxieties, discourage active engagement with local social realities, and erode opportunities to identify changes that are appropriate as well as practical and socially effective.\n\nEstablishing a Public Health Emergency Operations Center\n\nTo ensure effective response to an infectious disease outbreak, countries need a well-resourced PHEOC. In the event of a crisis, the PHEOC will integrate public health services with other parts of the health system and incorporate resources from outside the health sector into an emergency management model to implement the outbreak response plan (WHO, 2015a). The PHEOC will be responsible for coordinating all sectors involved in delivering the response plan, including those beyond the health sector, as well as the training and deployment of emergency workforce resources. To be effective, the PHEOC will need to be well established, with appropriate resources and financing, and to have developed and tested the required coordination mechanisms in advance, preferably through rehearsals. The PHEOC should have direct access to national disease surveillance and laboratory systems and possess infrastructure to enable rapid analysis of information to inform decision making. The PHEOC should also work with development partners and regional and global networks to identify where international support is most needed and coordinate its delivery to affected communities.\n\nNATIONAL GOVERNMENTS' RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT THEIR OWN PEOPLE AND PLAY THEIR PART\n\nIN PROTECTING HUMANKIND BY IMPLEMENTING THE INTERNATIONAL HEALTH REGULATIONS\n\nNational governments must take the responsibility to prevent, detect, and control infectious diseases outbreaks; to protect their own populations; and to play their part in protecting global health security. This goal can only be achieved in full when countries have built effective public health services, operating as an integral part of resilient health systems and capable of recognizing, reporting, and arresting the spread of infectious diseases. This cannot be achieved overnight. To ensure that national governments are equipped to achieve this goal, the Commission proposes a set of recommendations.\n\nClear Definition of Core Capacities and Benchmarks\n\nA clear definition of public health core capacities and functioning is needed to enable countries to develop concrete plans and facilitate compliance with the IHR. Establishing benchmarks is also key for conducting robust, objective assessments and identifying gaps, which in turn will allow prioritization of expenditures and enable accountability.\n\nRecommendation B.1: The World Health Organization, in collaboration with member states, should develop an agreed-on, precise definition and benchmarks for national core capabilities and functioning, based on, and implemented through, the International\n\nHealth Regulations and building on the experiences of other efforts, including the Global Health Security Agenda and the World Organization for Animal Health Terrestrial Animal Health Code by the end of\n\nIt should not be necessary to open the IHR to renegotiation to determine new definitions and benchmarks, because these could be developed through informal means, such as by an Annex or through the Director-General's (DG's) operational benchmarks for implementing the IHR (Gostin et al., 2015). The need for a clear roadmap that moves away from implementation checklists was also identified by the IHR Review Committee on Second Extensions for Establishing National Public Health Capacities and on IHR Implementation and approved by World Health Assembly (WHA) Resolution 68.5.\n\nObjective, Independent, and Transparent Assessment of Individual Country Performance Will Enable Prioritization and Reinforce Accountability In 2011, WHO issued a comprehensive IHR Core Capacity Monitoring Framework and accompanying monitoring tool to all member countries to enable them to assess their capacities ( WHO, 2011a). This tool contains 13 sections and more than 100 subsets of information. WHO has received detailed self-assessment reports from the member countries since 2011 on an annual basis. During the past 5 years, 98 percent of all states parties have responded to the monitoring questionnaire at least once (WHO, 2016). The monitoring tool has enabled countries to understand the significance of complying with the IHR and has also lent a measure of in-country accountability. There is greater awareness of health security issues and the necessity to build core capacities. Most countries have instituted an NFP and established a communication link between the country and WHO focal points. This in itself is a vast improvement over the pre-2005 IHR period.\n\nThus, while the IHR have undoubtedly been a valuable legal instrument (WHO, 2011b), the WHO monitoring tool and its subsequent revisions, though developed by experts, do not provide clear guidance for countries on how to prioritize implementation actions.\n\nWhile many have focused on training human resources, building surveillance systems for reporting of outbreaks, establishing reporting and review mechanisms, and creating rapid response teams for containing outbreaks, others have focused on less critical elements-for instance, procuring thermoscans for screening at airports.\n\nThe IHR reports submitted by member states have limited credibility, primarily because they are selfassessments. Furthermore, the WHO monitoring tool only allows for binary yes-or-no answers to many questions. For example, under Core Capacity 1 for the category \"National Legislation,\" many countries would need to revise several laws to be truly \"compliant\" with IHR requirements. However, for instance, updating a Public Health Act without any changes to other laws, such as the wildlife or environment laws, would allow them to report themselves as compliant. Or, for example, under Core Capacity 2, for \"Coordination and NFP Communications,\" multisectoral task forces may have been constituted, but their meetings are often irregular and not conducted until after an outbreak has occurred. Likewise, while NFPs have been established, they are often small units lacking infrastructure, trained personnel, and adequate budgets.\n\nProposed Structure of the Assessment We propose the following structure for the assessment.\n\nThe objective assessment should be overseen by an independent panel appointed by the Technical Governing Board of WHO's Center for Health Emergency Preparedness and Response (CHEPR) and answerable first to the WHO DG and ultimately to the Executive Board and the WHA. (WHO CHEPR is a key element of our recommendations for WHO and discussed at length in the next chapter.) This body will be responsible for defining metrics and developing instruments and tools to measure progress on implementation of core capacities. This panel will build on the IHR current assessment\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY34 mechanism and lessons learned from other initiatives, such as the GHSA experience.\n\nBecause it will not be possible at the start to conduct assessments of every country simultaneously, the panel should prioritize countries most in need of an external assessment. Countries should also have the ability to request an external assessment. Ultimately, assessments should be conducted on an annual basis, but we recognize that getting to this point will take some time. Peer representatives from both within and outside the region should play a key role in conducting panel reviews. The panel should develop an annual report to present to the WHA (which should also be made public) that should include progress on the implementation of core capacities and indicators that track notification and verification of events, communication, and coordination with NFPs.\n\nThe assessment tools should be approved by the WHA and measure performance in two main areas: 1. implementation of core capacities (including national legislation, coordination and NFP communications, surveillance, response, preparedness, risk communication, and laboratory capacity); and 2. early detection, notification, and response to outbreaks.\n\nDiscussion of the results of this assessment should include members of the country under assessment in order to ensure agreement on recommendations for support and follow-up.\n\nIn designing the details of this assessment mechanism, the panel should draw on the experience of analogous assessment mechanisms from outside the health sector, such as the World Bank's Doing Business reports, which are detailed assessments of the regulatory and infrastructure environment for establishing a business, or the Financial Action Task Force Mutual Evaluation mechanism, which is a peer-review process focused on the effectiveness of anti-money laundering systems and regulations. In both examples, the assessments are rigorous, objective, and transparent and serve a powerful purpose in galvanizing policy.\n\nWe recognize that such assessment processes inevitably generate frictions and disputes about methodology. The Commission is fully aware of the debates (Bialik, 2009) following WHO's World Health Report 2000 (WHO, 2000). Our objective here is not to create a ranking, nor to assess overall health system perfor- mance, but to provide a focused assessment of critical public capacities with the goal of enabling prioritization and accountability. Rigorous, objective, and transparent assessment will help identify weaknesses and illuminate opportunities to improve national prevention, detection, and response systems.\n\nWithout appropriate incentives, countries may seek to avoid objective and transparent assessment and thereby continue to neglect their health system capacities and infrastructure. One potential way to encourage participation in the assessment mechanism is to make external funding from the World Bank and/or other partners contingent on participation.\n\nAnother potential mechanism for encouraging countries to meet domestic and international obligations around pandemic preparedness should be for the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) to include assessments of pandemic preparedness in their country assessments. As discussed in Chapter 2, infectious disease outbreaks represent a substantial threat to countries' economic prosperity. Appropriately reflecting the risk associated with under-preparedness in assessments of macroeconomic stability would allow economic actors to take such risks into account when making decisions about investments and loans. Access to capital through development banks, capital markets, or foreign direct investment may be adversely affected if countries are known to have underdeveloped pandemic prevention and response capacities. If the IMF routinely included the outcomes of external assessments of national pandemic preparedness in its reviews of countries' economic and financial situations, countries keen to engage in global financial markets would have to pay heed. Those that chose to avoid external assessment would risk adverse signaling.\n\nPrimary responsibility for achieving and sustaining public health capacities to the required standard rests with national governments. We therefore call on governments to develop and publish plans by mid-2017 (where plans do not already exist) to achieve benchmark status in the required core capacities by 2020. These plans should be comprehensive and realistic, addressing the challenges of sustainable financing and skills building.\n\nCountry plans should also be aligned with global initiatives that share similar objectives, such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted in September 2015 by the UN General Assembly under the title Transforming Our World-The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.5 This initiative represents a global compact and movement that will be the vehicle for mobilizing and galvanizing country and global actors for concerted action on national and global issues. The SDGs will be used for holding country leaders accountable and can also act as the entry point for bringing the global health security agenda into the routine work of the UN, including the Security Council.\n\nTo assist national governments in developing and implementing plans to build stronger core capacities, WHO should provide technical assistance, ensuring the transfer of best practices.\n\nSDG3, which is to \"ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages,\" has three specific goals-(3.d) on outbreak preparedness and response, (3.b) on vaccines, research and development and (3.c) on health financing and health workforce recruitment, development and retention. See https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/ post2015/transformingourworld (accessed April 1, 2016). 5\n\nFinancing the Required Improvements in National Public Health Systems\n\nPublic health services are an integral part of any health system and a key driver of health system resilience. However, public health is often starved of investment, even relative to other parts of the health system (RWJF, 2013). Why is this?\n\nOne reason is a certain level of invisibility of outcomes, as explained earlier in this chapter. Avoiding outbreaks is a negative achievement. Building resilience can be difficult to measure and easy to undervalue. As in the Biblical parable of the house on the sand and the house on the rock, weak foundations are only exposed when the storm hits (Matthew 7:24-27). Secondly, national resource constraints and competing priorities mean that investment in strong and resilient health systems, which deliver benefits over the long term, often gets crowded out amid clamor for spending in areas where the benefits are more immediately and directly obvious. This problem is particularly acute in the poorest countries, but it is not unique to them. Even rich countries have this challenge. It takes a crisis like Ebola to reveal the enormous social and economic costs of neglecting the fundamental infrastructure and capacities of national health systems.\n\nThirdly, the prioritization of global aid agendas and financing mechanisms can create challenges in building coherent and resilient health systems. A focus on specific diseases (vertical programs) and other health-related targets, which prevails in much of the international development assistance community, can lead to neglect and fragmentation of the underlying health system (Flessa and Marx, 2016; Oliveira and Russo, 2015). For understandable reasons, many donors take a deliberately narrow focus, channeling their resources and energies toward meeting sharply defined program targets for specific diseases. Such single-minded focus helps deliver short-term results. However, a profusion of narrowly focused initiatives, each pursuing specific program goals\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY36 without much attention to linking the public health and health care delivery systems, can create a kind of \"tragedy of the commons,\" as Garrett Hardin described in 1968 (Hardin, 1968).\n\nThis phenomenon was somewhat evident in West Africa during Ebola. Before the epidemic, and despite neglected and fragile health systems, vertical program funding had enabled gains in specific indicators, such as child and maternal health and immunization. Yet during Ebola, health systems collapsed and those specific gains from vertical programs were reversed, at least in part. Neglecting the foundation makes the gains from other health programs extremely fragile.\n\nReinforcing health system resilience and preparedness at the level of individual countries will require sustained incremental spending, given the significant gaps in capacities and infrastructure of many countries. Estimating the scale of incremental investment required is challenging, as the available information on each country's current status is far from perfect, and the costs of upgrading capacities will vary substantially among different countries. Even taking these challenges into account, however, it is obvious that significant investment is needed to strengthen national systems. Currently, only one-third of countries report themselves to be fully compliant with IHR guidelines (WHO, 2015c), and even this may be an overstatement, given that compliance is self-assessed and benchmarks broadly defined.\n\nThe most credible estimate of the costs of reinforcing national capacities and infrastructure to achieve IHR compliance comes from a 2012 World Bank report, which concluded that achieving compliance for only low- and middle-income countries would cost between $1.9 and $3.4 billion6 per year (World Bank, 2012). This figure includes expenditures on a range of essential functions across both human and animal health sectors.7 For human public health systems, these include the costs of All monetary figures in U.S. dollars. 7 The estimates were developed following a 2-year process of research and expert consultation, involving the collection of budget data from 88 countries. Estimates of required spending were disaggregated by service and disease type in order to produce global estimates of the expenditures needed to meet WHO/OIE standards, and estimates of annual spending were extrapolated to the full set of 139 low- and middle-income countries. The report emphasized a One Health approach, entailing interdisciplinary collaboration among systems focused on human, animal, and environmental health. This approach to pandemic preparedness can be justified on two grounds: first, zoonotic diseases constitute the bulk (more than 60 percent) of emerging infectious diseases; and second, many of the elements of One Health 6 strengthening surveillance and diagnostic capacities, as well as upgrading disease control measures. For veterinary health services, the costs of surveillance, biosecurity, diagnostics, and control, as well as culling and resultant compensation, are included, along with the costs of enhancing wildlife surveillance, diagnosis, and disease control.\n\nWhile the World Bank estimates might be based on imperfect data, there is good reason to believe that they reasonably represent the scale of investment required. A 2009 estimate by the IOM/National Research Council Committee on Achieving Sustainable Global Capacity for Surveillance and Response to Emerging Diseases of Zoonotic Origin concluded that an annual expenditure of $1.34 billion would be needed annually through 2020 to address the pandemic threat of avian influenzas alone (IOM and NRC, 2009). It thus seems reasonable that strengthening national systems to address the broader threat posed by all potential pandemic disease agents will cost even more. Indeed, taking into account the need to upgrade capacities in many higher-income countries-as well as the low- and middle-income countries included in the World Bank analysis-it is likely that the overall investment gap today is nearer the upper end of the World Bank estimates ($3.4 billion). This amount is in addition to other investments recently proposed for health systems strengthening. For example, the Lancet Commission on Investing in Health proposed an incremental investment in health systems strengthening of $17 billion per year to 2035; however, this estimate did not include the resource demands to prepare for new infectious threats, such as pandemic influenza ( Jamison et al., 2013).\n\nIn considering potential sources of such incremental funding, two key considerations are sustainability and externalities. Health systems resilience should be viewed by all countries as an ongoing requirement, rather than a one-off effort, so the funding approach needs to be sustainable. Furthermore, given that it is the foundation of health security, spending on public health infrastructure and capacities such as surveillance systems and laboratory networks should be seen as a component of national security expenditures, and therefore as an integral part of a government's fundamental duty to protect its people. A country's investment in public health capabilities and strategies, such as national laboratory networks, would be applicable to any emerging disease threat. infrastructure also creates positive externalities, because other countries will benefit from the resulting reduction in infectious disease risk (and, conversely, the failure to make such investments creates negative externalities). The presence of such powerful externalities underscores the logic of high-income countries supporting lowincome countries in making these investments.\n\nIn this context, we suggest the following: • High-income and upper-middle-income countries must make achievement of the IHR core capacities a central part of the government's expenditure, most likely funded through general resources or possibly via dedicated taxes.8 Civil society will be able to hold governments accountable for devoting sufficient resources to achieving IHR compliance through the mechanism of independent assessment described in Chapter 3. For countries in these income brackets, it also makes sense to establish emergency contingency funds where they do not already exist. Such funds could cover a broader range of potential emergencies than pandemics alone. • Lower-middle-income and low-income countries should discuss with their multilateral and bilateral partners the appropriate balance of domestic resource mobilization and external support (which might be directed at helping upgrade capacities and infrastructure, contingent on local governments' commitments to maintain support thereafter). This could be achieved through a range of options, including: 1. individual country-level negotiations with donor partners around national plans to rectify gaps; 2. negotiations under the umbrella of existing multi-country initiatives, such as the GHSA and the World Bank-funded Laboratory Network in 18 countries in east, central, and southern Africa; 3. through the creation of a new fund, with grants and/or loans linked to commitment to ongoing financial support from domestic resources; and 4. a combination of Options 1 and 2, with the World Bank providing overall coordination to minimize duplication and gaps.\n\nFor example, the IOM/National Research Council Committee on Achieving Sustainable Global Capacity for Surveillance and Response to Emerging Diseases of Zoonotic Origin suggested a possible tax on the meat trade (IOM and NRC, 2009). 8\n\nWe believe Option 4 provides the optimal blend of flexibility for funding efforts in lower-middle- and lowincome countries. This would enable the global community to build on the momentum of initiatives such as the GHSA, leveraging other, more focused health financing vehicles such as Gavi and the Global Fund and drawing on new potential sources of financial support, such as the New Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. We believe Option 3, a dedicated fund specifically focused on pandemics, would not be optimal, given that the investment we envisage is so integrally entwined with the reinforcement of the overall health system and overlaps with initiatives to target other health challenges, such as antimicrobial resistance (AMR).\n\nWhatever the initial balance between domestic and donor spending, there should be a plan to reduce reliance on external funding through domestic resource mobilization. Building and sustaining local health system resilience should be seen as a core function of the national government and integral part of the budget. For example, the visible economic growth reported in many African countries should also be reflected in growing health expenditure.\n\nFor fragile and failed states, where local governments are not in a position to develop or execute such plans (let alone fund them), there should be a strategy for building and sustaining the most critical public health capacities to the extent possible. This will also be true where governments systematically ignore their responsibilities, pay only lip service to them, or allow implementation to be fatally undermined by corruption. Given that each of these situations has unique characteristics, this report refrains from prescribing a single approach to addressing and resourcing such challenges. However, it is clearly in the interest of global health security to incorporate consideration of infectious disease preparedness and response challenges in determining the UN or broader international strategy toward such situations.\n\nIrrespective of a country's income level, the health systems investments described here should be guided by: • a clear definition of the core capacities required (see Recommendation B.1); • rigorous, objective, and transparent assessment of current performance against these defined capacities (see Recommendation B.2); and\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY38\n\n• clear and detailed plans to rectify gaps, including the costs of upgrading core capacities and a model for sustainable funding.\n\nCLOSING REMARKS\n\nWhile the public health component of a health system is the first line of defense against the threat of infectious diseases, it has been seriously neglected by even the most advanced economies. Strengthening public health capacities should be a health security priority for governments and the global community. To achieve this, WHO, in coordination with member states, should develop clear standards and benchmarks for national core capacities and functioning and devise a regular, independent, and transparent assessment mechanism to evaluate countries' compliance.\n\nAt the country level, political will is essential to develop and implement plans to achieve and maintain benchmark core capacities. For resource-limited countries and fragile and failed states, the World Bank should develop finance mechanisms in collaboration with other multilaterals and development partners to support these efforts. This funding should be conditional upon a country's compliance with the external assessment mechanism. WHO should play an important role in providing technical expertise to support countries in the implementation of such plans. Strengthening public health systems will not only prevent a future outbreak from spinning out of control, but also support other critical efforts to combat global health threats, such as AMR.\n\nANNEX 3-2 Uganda Case Study\n\nPolitical Commitment: National Legislation and Development Plans\n\nFollowing the 2000 Ebola outbreak and based on results from an assessment of the vertical surveillance strategy in place at the time, a 5-year strategic plan for the health sector was developed and implemented (MOH, 2000). This assessment indicated that investment and improvement on the existing passive, limited approach to collecting surveillance information and the less-than optimal coordination and communication between the district, regional, and national levels would result in reducing the threat, morbidity, and mortality of epidemics through an early-warning system and quick response (Lukwago et al., 2012; Phalkey et al., 2013). As part of the new strategy, Uganda moved to strengthen WHO's \"Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response Strategy.\"\n\nCoordination and Collaboration\n\nThe Ugandan system is coordinated by a standing multidisciplinary and multisectoral National Task Force (NTF) that meets monthly to review surveillance data and update preparedness plans; during an outbreak, the NTF meets daily (Aceng, 2015). It is led by the Director General of the Ministry of Health (MOH), and its members are drawn from various fields of expertise, including epidemiology, veterinary medicine, communication, and laboratory science-all from various ministries within the government, the military, the Office of the Prime Minister, research institutions and universities; representatives from WHO and the CDC; and participants from civil society and NGOs such the Uganda Red Cross and Médecins Sans Frontières (Aceng, 2015).\n\nA PHEOC was recently established to assist the NTF and the district task forces (DTFs) created by coordinating emergency capacities through receiving, evaluating, and distributing information collected from\n\nCHAPTER 3 ANNEX\n\nANNEX 3-1\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY40 surveillance activities, laboratories, and communication networks (Bourchert et al., 2014). The PHEOC is activated immediately following outbreak detection (Aceng, 2015).\n\nCommunity Engagement Social mobilization has been critical to Uganda's success. Local leaders and various professionals are involved throughout the discussion and are trained on basic principles of identifying certain diseases, such as Ebola (Lamunu et al., 2004). Respect for cultural traditions and understanding of knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of the affected area shapes the mobilization effort, and the government works closely with the United Nations Children's Fund and the Uganda Red Cross to engage traditional healers and religious leaders to support social mobilization efforts (Aceng, 2015; Lamunu et al., 2004; Mbonye et al., 2014).\n\nIntegrated Disease Surveillance System\n\nThe disease surveillance system functions at all country levels: national, sub-national, district, and sub-district. A DTF exists in all 112 districts of the country. Its membership is comprised of political, health, and community leaders and relevant technical advisors, led by the politically elected Chairman of the Local Council (Borchert et al., 2011). There are designated surveillance and laboratory focal persons at the district and regional levels who regularly receive and review surveillance information (Aceng, 2015). Village health teams are responsible for 20-30 households and were established as an integral component of the national strategic plan to improve access to care, social mobilization, governance coordination, and community-based preventive or rehabilitation services (Aceng, 2015; MOH, 2000, 2015).\n\nInformation Systems and Use of Technology\n\nData from all health facilities in the country are shared with providers and health workers through a weekly epidemiological bulletin produced by the MOH Epidemiology and Surveillance Division and Resource Center. A comprehensive short message service (SMS) alert system is established to boost surveillance, with members of the District Rapid Response Teams, the District Surveillance Officer, and the hub coordinator sending texts to the system, which then forwards alerts to all members of the NTF. The SMS reporting system and a specimen tracking system are accessible to the PHEOC through the District Health Information System (DHIS-2), which is used to report national health data and provide real-time monitoring and evaluation through an online platform. Access to the DHIS-2, which is now linked up with the SMS facility data transmission system, allows the PHEOC to be the primary center of communication and the coordination site of response decisions and subsequent implementation by the NTF in an emergency (Bourchert et al., 2014). The use of standardized forms for data collection, as well as a specific individual assigned to data management for each outbreak, allows for coordinated management and dissemination of information to health care workers and the public (Aceng, 2015).\n\nInfrastructure and Laboratory Capacity\n\nLaboratory services are available beginning at the health sub-district level and grow increasingly more complex in scaling up the health system, with approximately 1,700 health facilities providing basic minimum laboratory services (Kiyaga et al., 2013). A biosafety level 3 laboratory at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI), funded in part by the CDC after a 2007 Ebola outbreak, allows for fast turnaround and identification of samples (Aceng, 2015; Mbonye et al., 2014; MOH, 2000). Samples are concurrently sent to the CDC for testing. The decentralized laboratory network allows for isolation units to be set up when the need arises, allowing for quick control and containment. Upon confirmation, a daily situation report called the \"Sitrep\" is produced and distributed, and WHO is notified immediately (Aceng, 2015).\n\nAs many health facilities have only basic laboratory services, a National Sample and Results Transport Network was established to allow for quick and efficient transport of samples, coordinated by the Central Public Health Laboratory. Funded in part by the Global Fund, the transport network identified 77 hubs throughout the country with enhanced laboratory capacity (Aceng, 2015; Global Fund, 2014; Kiyaga et al., 2013). The hubs act as a coordinating center and serve approximately 20- 40 health facilities in a 30-40 km radius around the hub (Kiyaga et al., 2013). Each hub is serviced by a motorbike rider who visits 4-8 hubs on a given day. They reach every facility at least once per week, delivering the previous week's results and picking up samples (Aceng, 2015; Kiyaga et al., 2013; Mbonye et al., 2014). In emergency situations, riders for each hub are on reserve to pick up samples, and transport them to the postal service, Posta Uganda, for transportation to UVRI. This process in its entirety is designed to take less than 24 hours (Aceng, 2015). SMS alerts are sent to the hub coordinator at each point to notify them of specimen registration, UVRI receipt, and release of results, with data in parallel tracked through DHIS-2 (Aceng, 2015).\n\nHealth Workforce Capacity\n\nCurrently the country is implementing a comprehensive training in all the 14 Regional Referral Hospitals to build standby Case Management Teams readily available to support respective districts as need arises. These will further serve as the decentralized monitoring and evaluation centers for Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response countrywide. Surveillance efforts are boosted with the CDC's FETP. This program trains field epidemiologists in investigating any unusual deaths or occurrences, and these field epidemiologists are deployed with surveillance officers to assist with contact tracing (Aceng, 2015).\n\nCommunity health workers (CHWs), who comprise the village health teams, are trained on standardized clinical and community case definitions, reporting of any unusual events, and surveillance activities to enable early reporting from the community level to their respective attachment health facilities (Aceng, 2015; Lamunu et al., 2004; MOH, 2015).\n\nCommunication and Education CHWs serve as a valuable link between the community and the health sector. For example, in cases where the patient is kept in isolation, CHWs brief families on a daily basis and contact burial teams to bury the dead with dignity while maintaining adherence to outbreak control practices (Aceng, 2015). The media is well utilized with daily radio discussions, \"aggressive\" documentary screenings of previous outbreaks, and widely circulated posters and dissemination (Aceng, 2015; Lamunu et al., 2004).\n\nSummary\n\nIn summary, taking the lessons learned from the 2000 Ebola outbreak, Uganda started a process of building public health core capacities that strengthened its surveillance and response systems, which significantly improved the outcome of several subsequent Ebola outbreaks. As shown in Table 3-5, these key elements implemented aligned very well with the core capacities included in the legally binding IHR.\n\nANNEX 3-3 Rwanda Case Study\n\nWhere needed, governments should work with development partners to strengthen health systems capacity with an approach that focuses on country ownership and accountability. Rethinking the current approach to aid implementation and management in building health\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY42 systems can bring about significant improvement in the breadth and quality of care provided, as well as in countries' social and economic development. This is demonstrated best through the study of Rwanda and how the country has transformed its circumstance beginning from the ruins of the 1994 genocide to being \"the only country in the region on track to meet each of the health-related millennium development goals by 2015\" (Farmer et al., 2013).\n\nThe Vision 2020 policy, Rwanda's comprehensive national plan, provides a clear, long-term development path and objectives for moving forward post-genocide. These comprehensive and transparent development plans allow for coordination among the government, donors, and implementing partners. Critical to the progress achieved is the strict adherence to country ownership and accountability, maintained in an effort to further national capacity building by \"reducing the country's dependence on external aid\" (MoFEP, 2000). The Rwanda Aid Policy, published by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning in 2006, explicitly states, \"The Government will decline any or all offers of assistance where it considers transaction costs to be unacceptably high, alignment to government priorities to be insufficient, or conditionalities to be excessive\" (MoFEP, 2006). This ensures investment in national systems and institutions-investment that is beneficial to countries with weak institutional capacity (UN Office of the Special Envoy for Haiti, 2012). This does not mean, however, that vertical funding from programs such as the Global Fund or the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) should be turned away. Instead, funds can be harnessed to build and strengthen platforms for integrated service delivery (Walton, 2004). In Rwanda, funds from PEPFAR, the Global Fund, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) were used to launch the Human Resources for Health program to combat shortages in health personnel with investments in health facilities and training (Binagwaho et al., 2013). Leveraging shared infrastructure, such as supply chain and procurement systems, laboratory capacity, health personnel, and information management also enabled greater efficiency in the system through improved access to care at lower cost (Farmer et al., 2013; Porter et al., 2009). Finding opportunities for funders to work in alignment with the government's agenda have proven successful, with dramatic changes observed in poverty, life expectancy, spread of infectious disease, and child mortality (Binagwaho et al., 2014).\n\nThe Vision 2020 policy emphasizes reduction of inequality through improved access to high-quality health care and education, especially for previously neglected rural communities (MoFEP, 2000). Often, despite millions of dollars in aid, individuals who rely on the help of national institutions see little improvement in their situations. In the case of Sierra Leone, a country hugely impacted by the ongoing Ebola outbreak despite more than $712 million in aid, only 5 percent was funneled into national systems, therefore bypassing communities who would stand to benefit most (Office of the Secretary-General's Special Adviser on Community Based Medicine and Lessons from Haiti, 2015). Rwanda has addressed this issue by implementing and managing its own effective system to track donor disbursements, based on recommendations from the Paris Declaration of Aid Effectiveness (UN Office of the Special Envoy for Haiti, 2012). Utilizing donors' external aid-tracking systems instead of letting governments take ownership in tracking disbursement \"undermines the government's appropriation of the process and the validity of the figures\" (UNDP, 2010). Including aid management and documented delivery in policy recommendations, such as in Rwanda's Donor Performance Assessment Framework, allows for effective, timely, and high-quality data on aid programs and management (MoFEP, 2010). This holds the performance of donors accountable against \"a set of established indicators on the quality and volume of development assistance,\" ensuring the establishment of transparent dialogue, and \"allow[s] for comparison, individual reflection on performance, accountability and peer pressure\" among all involved partners (MoFEP, 2010). These data are essential for enabling the government to make evidence-based decisions to strengthen the public sector and effectively deliver public services (UN Office of the Special Envoy for Haiti, 2012). Rwanda observed 58 percent of its aid channeled into country systems in 2010, allowing for vast progress to be made in building and strengthening the country's health system (UN Office of the Special Envoy for Haiti, 2012).\n\nFrom this experience, we can also learn that bridging gaps in access to care for marginalized communities can be accomplished with community-based interventions quickly and at low cost. As of 2012, approximately 91 percent of the country was enrolled in the national community-based insurance scheme with subsidized premiums and co-payments on an income-based tiered payment structure that allowed for the poorest enrollees to obtain access to health care (Farmer et al., 2013). Strengthening community-based interventions by scaling up numbers of community health workers was accomplished rapidly and at low cost. These personnel are considered essential for bridging the health care worker gap through providing treatment, monitoring, surveillance, referral, and reporting services, and allowing for strong community linkages to be formed with the national health care system (Binagwaho et al., 2014). Rwanda's inclusion of clear guidelines for financing, management, and delivery in its national policy has indeed helped overcome disparities in access to highquality health care. It is important to keep in mind for the future that, as in the Ebola response, we have witnessed that where high-quality care was provided, Ebola patients survived. This is strong testimony to a national policy that builds a resilient, country-owned health system, thereby preventing future spread of disease and saving countless lives.\n\nANNEX 3-4 Acknowledging the Roots of Resistance and Distrust of Containment Measures\n\nTo understand community resistance and distrust of containment measures in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia during the Ebola epidemic, it is important to understand the history of public health approaches in the region. During the 2014 Ebola epidemic, journalists noted that establishing a cordon sanitaire was \"a tactic unseen in a century\" (McNeil, 2014). But restrictive and authoritarian tactics were used throughout the previous century by both colonial and independent governments. Outbreaks of yellow fever, smallpox, cholera, and bubonic plague joined the chronic affliction of malaria, and were met with a host of restrictive or punitive measures, including the destruction of housing, highly restrictive building codes and outright segregation, quarantine, isolation, and fines for infractions. These were all applied in discriminatory fashion, sparing Europeans in a manner that rankled Africans.\n\nEthnographic research as well as a survey of radio and print media suggest that citizens of all three coun- tries have long-lived memories of prior campaigns to wall-offvillages afflicted by smallpox, Lassa fever, influenza and even vector-borne diseases-such as plague, trypanosomiasis, and malaria.\n\nIn all three countries, wars had weakened already rickety public health systems, which were largely focused on restrictive and punitive measures and included little in the way of care; this was especially true in the eastern reaches of the \"trizone area\" in which the three countries come together. In Sierra Leone, the arsenal of measures taken to halt smallpox and malaria in the colonial period sounds eerily familiar to those seen in the recent Ebola response. These included fines (there was a two-pound fine levied on households \"hiding\" victims; the threat of mandatory quarantine within contagious disease \"hospitals\" with little in the way of medical or nursing care; other legal actions in 1914-1915, there were 1,333 \"mosquito larva court cases,\" even though the ditches and puddles remained ubiquitous); more futile and corrosive attempts to segregate Freetown; and efforts to restrict population movements (Cole, 2015; Rashid, 2011; Spitzer, 1968; Tomkins, 1994).\n\nSimilar approaches were adopted in French West Africa. Yet although the \"sanitarians\" were obsessed with disease control, this did not mean they were effective at controlling disease. Plague was in the end halted by more DDT and therapeutic advances, than by quarantine, travel bans, or the destructions of housing. Similar control-only approaches were applied to smallpox, and were often resisted (Greenough, 1995). Although the case-fatality of the disease varied widely, the primary approach to smallpox put all the emphasis on control rather than care: quarantine, isolation, ring vaccination, and walling off affected villages, which were sometimes razed. In both 1967 and 1968, Sierra Leone had the world's highest incidence of smallpox among \"all countries reporting to the World Health Organization\" (Hopkins et al., 1971).\n\nCaregiving did not, however, fit readily into the conceptions of the \"sanitarians\" of tropical medicine. Obsessed with disease control, they paid scant heed to supportive care. Their intense focus on containment and control and lack of interest in care left a potent legacy that undoubtedly influenced communities' reactions to actions taken in the context of Ebola. Coupled with tensions remaining from recent conflicts in each of the three countries and the corrosive effects of corruption on public trust, this history of control-oriented public\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY44 health created a very challenging context for community engagement (Dhillon et al., 2015; Pellecchia et al., 2015; Richards et al., 2015).\n\nTwo lessons leap out: first that caregiving is an essential component of an outbreak response strategy, in part because it is the right thing to do, and in part because it is essential to enlisting community support; and second, that effective community engagement requires understanding the context, including the history, that will inform people's attitudes and behaviors.\n\nAbramowitz, S. 2014.

Global action is an imperative because pandemic prevention and response are global public goods. Outbreak identification, prevention, and control efforts by one country benefit not only that country, but all countries ( Jonas, 2013). Weaknesses in one country endanger not only the local population, but all of humanity. Global health security is the opposite of a zero-sum game- benefits obtained by one country do not reduce benefits available to others, but actually increase them. However, as with all public goods, global health security suffers from free-rider incentives and coordination challenges (Frenk and Moon, 2013; Jonas, 2013). Therefore, strong international norms and collaboration are essential.\n\nTo ensure that critical functions for pandemic preparedness and response are performed well at the international level, the Commission recommends major changes to current global and regional arrangements. We believe that the World Health Organization (WHO) should play the leading role in coordinating pandemic preparedness and response, consistent with its constitu- tional mandate. Yet WHO needs to play this role much more effectively. To achieve this, WHO should: 1. recognize the significance of its role by creating a robust operational entity and contingency fund that can respond adequately to potential pandemics; 2. improve its ability to coordinate and cooperate with others in the global health landscape, including other United Nations (UN) agencies, regional networks, and non-state actors; and 3. redesign key protocols that would encourage early alerts and reporting and enable swift international response.\n\nThe Commission also believes that the multilateral finance agencies, such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), must play a leading role in mobilizing global financial resources in response to potential pandemics.\n\nSTRENGTHENING WHO'S CAPACITY FOR OUTBREAK PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE\n\nWith a constitutional mandate to be the global leader in disease surveillance, outbreak investigation, and response, WHO has the authority and obligation to play a significant role in delivering a range of essential functions (see Annexes 4-1 and 4-2 for more detail), including pro-\n\nWhile reinforcing the first line of defense at the country level is the foundation of the global health risk framework, strengthening international capabilities for outbreak preparedness, alert, and response is a second vital component. Improving and maintaining international capabilities is essential because infectious disease outbreaks quickly transcend national borders. Infectious disease outbreaks also require response strategies that extend beyond health-encompassing areas such as transportation, commerce, trade, finance, law, and communication.\n\nStrengthening the Global and Regional System for 4\n\nOutbreak Preparedness, Alert, and Response\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY48 viding technical assistance and aid in emergencies.1 In addition to its constitutional mandate, WHO's role is enshrined in the major treaty governing global health security, the International Health Regulations (IHR). The World Health Assembly (WHA) has also adopted numerous resolutions supporting WHO's mandate.2\n\nHowever, the Ebola crisis exposed many weaknesses in WHO's leadership and capabilities. Most notably, WHO did not help mobilize personnel, materials, and finances rapidly or at scale, despite clear evidence that the outbreak had overwhelmed the capacities of both states and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) (MSF, 2015). There were communication and coordination breakdowns among WHO, other agencies, and actors in the affected countries. There was duplication between humanitarian and outbreak clusters, causing confusion and inefficiencies.\n\nTo fulfill its constitutional mandate and regain the trust of governments and the public, WHO must make significant changes, strengthening its organizational and operational capabilities to lead and support outbreak preparedness and response while ensuring sound governance principles (Gostin, 2014).\n\nWHO Center for Health Emergency Preparedness and Response\n\nThe Commission considered four potential models of governance for global health security that were presented at a September 2015 Institute of Medicine workshop on governance for global health.3 Details on these models are provided in Annex 4-3 and in the published report of the workshop, Global Health Risk Frameworks: Governance for Global Health: Workshop Summary (NASEM, 2016). To summarize briefly: • Model A proposes that WHO strengthen execu- tion of its responsibilities for outbreak preparedness and response through improvements to existing structures.\n\nSee Article 2 of the WHO constitution for specifics on its roles and responsibilities (WHO, 2006). 2 Just to name a few, the World Health Assembly (WHA) resolution 58.1 on health action in relation to crises and disasters; WHA 59.22 on emergency preparedness and response; and WHA 65.2 on WHO's response and role as the health cluster lead in meeting the growing demands of health in humanitarian emergencies. 3 This workshop was held in London on September 1-2, 2015. For more information, see http://www.nap.edu/catalog/21854/globalhealth-risk-framework-governance-for-global-health-workshopsummary (accessed March 24, 2016). 1\n\n• Model B proposes the creation of a WHO center for humanitarian and outbreak management, overseen by a dedicated board, to give WHO more robust operational capabilities for outbreak preparedness and response. • Model C proposes that WHO execute a strategic and operational role in a health emergency under the formal mechanisms of the UN system. • Model D proposes that the UN create a new interagency entity for global health risks that would encompass capabilities not only from WHO, but also from other UN agencies, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).\n\nAssessing the Models Model D is clearly sub-optimal. Creating an additional UN entity would dilute WHO's credibility and form overlaps and duplication in partnerships, ties with health ministries, and legal authorities. Moreover, without established relationships and access to WHO's other capabilities, the new entity would find it difficult to manage the essential link between improving preparedness and managing outbreak response.\n\nThe reforms suggested for Model A are necessary, but not sufficient. More significant changes are required to ensure that WHO can fulfill its mandate effectively.\n\nThe Commission proposes an approach based mainly on Model B, with elements of Model C. Under this approach, WHO would have a new center with clear responsibility, resources, and capabilities to take the lead on outbreak preparedness and response, while taking advantage of the UN system's assets and being held accountable by a separate board chaired by the WHO Director-General (DG). Establishing this center, with a dedicated board, would strengthen WHO by providing a much stronger focal point for outbreak preparedness and response, and by establishing more apolitical governance and accountability arrangements for this vital component of WHO's role.\n\nIn fact, several other initiatives, including WHO's Ebola Interim Assessment Panel, have proposed models along broadly similar lines, incorporating elements of Models B and C (see Annex 4-4 for a snapshot of the proposals). Moreover, the DG has already begun to implement changes based on these proposals and input from member states (see Table 4-1). Specifically, the DG has already taken steps to create a program that would effectively integrate functions and units-across country, regional, and headquarter levels-that work on infectious disease outbreaks, on emergencies, and on risk analysis and assessment under the IHR.4 Although the Commission welcomes such steps, we propose some modifications and areas of emphasis.\n\nProgram Versus Center The Commission agrees that a new operational entity should be established within WHO to bring together and strengthen its capabilities to manage and coordinate preparedness and response. However, we believe it should be developed and described as a \"center,\" rather than a \"program,\" as we understand it is currently envisioned. WHO has numerous important programs that aim to advance global health. Yet we believe it is important to distinguish WHO's entity for outbreaks and health emergencies. This should be firmly established as a permanent part of the WHO system and given sufficient and sustainable funding to fulfill WHO's leadership mandate.\n\nPersonal communication, Director-General Margaret Chan, World Health Organization, November 20, 2015. 4\n\nSpecifically, we propose that WHO should establish a Center for Health Emergency Preparedness and Response (CHEPR). The CHEPR would operate in a nimble, scientific, and apolitical manner, coordinating operational information and resources for strategic management of infectious disease outbreaks and other public health events and emergencies, including the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Similar to what has been proposed by other post-Ebola reform initiatives, the CHEPR would have robust capabilities to manage surveillance for outbreaks and events, risk assessment, planning and execution of response, assessment of IHR functions and compliance, coordination with partners, risk communication, quality assurance, and monitoring (Moon et al., 2015; WHO, 2015a,g).\n\nMoreover, the CHEPR should coordinate the global health emergency workforce (WHO, 2015d). To facilitate this, it should strengthen the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), which pools human and technical resources from existing institutions and networks to support international outbreak identification, confirmation, and response. GOARN has faced challenges in scaling up responses to outbreaks, given\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY50 limited numbers of staff and the challenges of finding personnel who are ready to deploy rapidly and possess relevant experience (WHO, 2015f ). The CHEPR should strengthen and expand GOARN, integrating national, regional, and global capabilities to reduce the current over-reliance on a limited group of partners. It should also ensure that members are trained and engaged in different stages and tasks of preparedness and response, including sharing information on alerts, risk assessments, integrated data management, logistics and communications, and field-based administrative procedures and protocols.\n\nAlthough the CHEPR should operate within the WHO Secretariat and be led by an Executive Director, it should be overseen by a Technical Governing Board (TGB), as detailed below.\n\nExecutive Director and StaffAn Executive Director at the level of Deputy DG should lead the CHEPR, and the post should be filled through an external, open recruitment. The CHEPR staff should have a variety of skills in areas such as management, health security, public health systems, epidemiologic surveillance, medical anthropology, risk communication, clinical medicine, health information technologies, logistics, security, and technology. In addition, staff should have excellent leadership competencies and a thorough understanding of diverse cultures, laws, and governance.\n\nTechnical Governing Board The Executive Director should report to a merit-based and multidisciplinary TGB. The TGB should be chaired by the DG, who should nominate members strictly on the basis of their technical expertise-not on member state representations. Members should come from various countries, regions, and sectors, including civil society organizations (CSOs), academia, and the private sector. Additionally, the TGB should include representatives from the UN and possibly the World Bank to enable multisectoral support and coordination of WHO's efforts. Some of the members of the TGB should head technical committees linked to the board. For example, a member of the TGB should head the panel tasked to oversee the assessment of national core capacities (see Chapter 3 for more on this panel). Similarly, a member of the TGB should head a committee tasked to prioritize diseases and research and development (R&D) needs (see Chapter 5 for more on the Pandemic Product Devel opment Committee). Members of these committees should be appointed by the DG based on their expertise and should be mostly external to WHO. TGB responsibilities should include the following: • Recruit, appoint, support, and evaluate the CHEPR Executive Director. • Ensure the CHEPR's fiscal integrity and preserve and protect its assets, including allocating, prioritizing, and safeguarding funds such as WHO's Contingency Fund for Emergencies (CFE) (discussed later in this chapter). • Ensure that the CHEPR's policies and processes are current, properly implemented, well prioritized, and of high quality. • Regularly review the latest information on threats that have the potential to become a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), drawing from the high-priority \"watch list\" of outbreaks (discussed later in this chapter). • Make recommendations to the DG, including when to call an emergency committee and declare a PHEIC (although the DG should still retain the legal power to make final decisions on both of these matters). • Oversee implementation of mechanisms to reinforce and monitor country reporting and compliance with the IHR. • Oversee implementation and deployment of the global emergency workforce. • Hold the CHEPR accountable by setting clear standards and objectives, monitoring and evaluating performance, and issuing periodic reports, which should be made public. • Report to the WHO Executive Board and the WHA on the progress of the CHEPR.5\n\nIntegration Across All WHO Levels\n\nWHO regional and country offices play important roles in promoting and coordinating efforts to counter infectious disease outbreaks. However, some WHO regional offices have faced challenges in working effectively with countries, with WHO headquarters, and with each other Additionally, as stated in Recommendation A.3, an independent review of the entire global health framework, including an assessment of the performance of the TGB, should be conducted in 2017 and every 3 years thereafter. 5\n\n(WHO, 2013). The discordant relationships were evident in the recent Ebola crisis, hindering swift and effective outbreak response (Gostin and Friedman, 2015). Additionally, recent surveys found that most WHO staff, especially at the headquarters level, view coordination and cooperation among headquarters and regional offices as not adequate (PWC, 2013; WHO, 2012). Although the WHO constitution gives WHO's governing bodies and the DG formal authority over the regional bodies, in practice, they have limited influence on the conduct or staffing of regional offices because authority rests with the regional directors, who are elected by regional member states (Clift, 2014). The election process makes the regional directors accountable first to their region's health ministers, rather than to headquarters, thereby impeding WHO's ability to act as a unified organization (Fineberg, 2014; Gostin and Friedman, 2015). The resulting lack of coordination is a particular hindrance when WHO needs to act decisively and swiftly in response to an outbreak.\n\nTo prepare and respond to outbreaks effectively, WHO must be able to speak and act coherently and consistently across all levels. Therefore, all relevant departments at WHO headquarters should be moved to the CHEPR, and equivalent structures and operating systems should be established at the regional level. Specifically, existing functions for health security and emergencies in regional offices should be merged (if this has not already been done) and vertically integrated under the CHEPR command-and-control structure. Further, the regional directors should only have \"dotted-line\" geographic oversight of these regional functions. Comparable systems should be set up at the national level as well, with linkages to the regional level, along similar lines as the regional and headquarters centers (but adapted as suitable for the country context).\n\nRecommendation C.1: By the end of 2016, the World Health Organization should create a Center for Health Emergency Preparedness and Response-integrating action at headquarters, regional, and country office levels-to lead the global effort toward outbreak preparedness and response. This center should be governed by an independent Technical Governing Board.\n\nFinancing WHO's Leadership Role in Pandemic Preparedness and Response\n\nProviding Funding Support for the CHEPR\n\nThe CHEPR must be supported with adequate resources to effectively perform its role in preparing for and responding to a potential PHEIC. Within the constraints of this exercise, we have had neither the access to information nor the time to construct detailed estimates of the additional resources required for the CHEPR or the extent to which WHO might be able to fund this incremental expenditure from savings elsewhere. Moreover, as noted earlier in the chapter, the CHEPR's role would extend beyond infectious disease threats to cover other health emergencies, such as the growing threat of AMR or biological terrorism. The resource requirements arising from this broader role are beyond the scope of this report.\n\nFor WHO to perform successfully its leadership role in countering the threat of infectious diseases, it needs stable and sufficient funding for the CHEPR. The Commission believes that the incremental funds needed should be acquired through an increase in WHO core contributions earmarked for this purpose, rather than through voluntary contributions, because preparedness and response to health emergencies must be supported as an ongoing core function of WHO. Analysis of WHO's budget allocation for responding to public health emergencies shows that funding has been responsive and erratic in the past, following a \"boom-bust\" pattern ( Hoffman, in press).\n\nThe Commission is aware that there has been considerable debate about the adequacy of WHO's overall core funding from assessed contributions, because it has remained flat in nominal terms for more than two decades (WHO, 2011). However, we have not attempted to address this broader issue, because it involves aspects of WHO's mandate and performance that are beyond this Commission's charge. For the purposes of estimating an aggregate level of funding required by the Commission's proposals, we have assumed that an increase in the core contributions from countries of 5 percent, or roughly $50 million6 over 2016-2017, would suffice to cover the incremental operational costs involved in the formation of the CHEPR. This corresponds to the increase recommended by WHO's Ebola Interim\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY52\n\nAssess ment Panel (WHO, 2015g) and to the increase in spending proposed for \"preparedness, surveillance and response\" in WHO's Proposed Programme Budget for 2016-2017 (WHO, 2015e).\n\nProviding Contingency Funding for Emergency Response\n\nIn addition to financing the CHEPR, there is a need for contingency funding to enable WHO to respond more rapidly to potential pandemics and to fill a critical gap from the onset of an emergency until resources from other financing mechanisms begin to flow, such as from the UN's Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) and donors.\n\nThe WHA has already approved the creation of a $100 million contingency fund, the WHO CFE, which aims to support WHO's initial response to outbreaks and emergencies (WHO, 2015h). Financing for this mechanism appears somewhat uncertain. The proposed approach is via voluntary contributions, yet thus far pledges from member states amount to less than one-third of the sum required. Deployment of the CFE would be triggered at the DG's discretion based on a justified, technically valid, budgeted request from the WHO incident manager, with initial funds to be made available with only minimal bureaucratic stipulations. Funding will be available for up to 3 months for deployment of emergency health personnel, coordination of medical response and transportation of personnel and supplies, information technology and analytical support of emergency response efforts, and creation and operation of field offices (WHO, 2015h). To ensure accountability and transparency, the CFE is subject to WHO's Financial Regulations and Financial Rules, and all income and expenditures from the fund will be reported annually to the WHA and donors and posted on the WHO website.\n\nThe Commission supports this proposal, as it offers the DG flexibility to move rapidly to respond to an outbreak, either after having declared a PHEIC or even before. Accountability for disbursements could be achieved through oversight by the TGB. Ultimately, the\n\nCFE's disbursement would also be constrained by the need to maintain good faith with member states, ensuring their continued willingness to fund replenishment. The proposed quantum of $100 million appears reasonable as a first source of funding that would complement other sources of emergency funding such as the World Bank's proposed Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (PEF) (discussed later in this chapter), the UN's CERF, and contingency funds held by other agencies (e.g., UNICEF, the Global Fund), at a regional level, or by individual member states.\n\nBecause the purpose of the CFE is to provide immediate and flexible financial resources in the event of an emergency, the CFE needs to be fully funded in advance or have immediate access to funds. There are at least four possible routes to achieving this: 1. Via an increment to the biennial assessed contribu- tions: The problem with this route is that with, say, a further 5 percent increment to assessed contributions, it would take 2 years to fund the mechanism. Thereafter, the fund would either be in surplus or deficit depending on whether or not any disbursements were made. It does not seem optimal to fund a contingency vehicle via a regular payment mechanism. 2. Via voluntary contributions: This is the route currently envisioned by WHO. The challenge here is securing sufficient contributions. 3. Via committed one-off initial contributions, assessed pro rata with the core assessed contributions: In this route, each member state would make a contribution to the fund in line with and in addition to its share of core assessed contributions. This could either be on the basis of actual cash contributions or via binding contingent commitments to fund the CFE. In the event of the DG's triggering the contingency fund, WHO could raise money from banks immediately against these binding commitments. Following deployment of all or part of the contingency fund, the DG would then ask for a replenishment round on the same basis. 4. Via an insurance scheme: The potential role for pandemic insurance is discussed in more detail below with respect to the World Bank's PEF. However, insurance is unlikely to be optimal for the CFE, given that the purpose of this fund is to have immediate discretionary funding flexibility. It would seem dif- ficult and certainly costly to structure an insurance arrangement that pays out on a sufficiently early discretionary trigger, particularly when the DG controls the trigger and receives the payout.\n\nGiven the potential for deficits (or surpluses) under Option 1, the potential shortfall and inequity under Option 2, and the costs and technical difficulties attending Option 4, the Commission recommends Option 3 as the optimal approach to funding the WHO CFE.\n\nCOORDINATING WITH GLOBAL ACTORS\n\nTo carry out its leadership responsibilities more effectively, WHO needs to improve its ability to coordinate across all three levels of the organization and with others in the global health landscape. These global actors include the UN, formal and informal regional networks, local and international CSOs, the private sector, and the media. Rather than waiting for the next outbreak, the WHO should proactively build relationships with these actors to identify their roles and responsibilities and establish ways of working together to leverage their strengths and improve coordination.\n\nThe UN Coordination mechanisms among WHO and other UN agencies should be strengthened to enhance outbreak preparedness and control. The Ebola outbreak showed that agencies within the UN Health Cluster failed to communicate and coordinate well with each other-or with other international, governmental, and nongovernmental actors-resulting in delayed, misinformed, or inadequate response efforts. For example, the UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) was created even though other regional and sub-regional entities, such as the Sub-Regional Ebola Operations and Coordination Center, and existing resources could have been leveraged to provide more timely and effective response efforts.7 To avoid such duplicative and costly efforts, responsibilities and accountabilities need to be made clear through common protocols and regular communication and strengthened through practice exercises.\n\nUnder the global health risk framework, the default or routine operations of the CHEPR should remain within WHO and be overseen by the TGB. However, when a crisis escalates to the extent that it poses a highlevel global health threat or evolves into a much broader humanitarian crisis, WHO should then play its role within a broader effort led by the UN Secretary General (UNSG). Because UN representatives would serve on the TGB, the UN would always be informed about possible threats that could require broader UN system support. In the case of such a high-level threat, the TGB (chaired by the DG) should report to the UN-led effort to ensure an integrated, holistic response. The UN would provide leadership and coordinate the efforts of the international community to support affected countries via the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), chaired by the Emergency Relief Coordinator. This would help ensure the appropriate level of political and financial commitment and facilitate intensified responses from other UN agencies.\n\nRegional Networks (Formal and Informal)\n\nAs we argued in Chapter 3, national capacities for disease surveillance and outbreak investigation and control are the first line of defense against potential pandemics.\n\n\"UNMEER was established on 19 September 2014 after resolutions from the United Nations General Assembly and the United Nations Security Council on the Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa. [...] The mission functioned by bypassing existing mechanisms, rather than by engaging the United Nations cluster system. While the approach was adapted in countries where the United Nations Resident Representative was engaged with the system, there were other instances where the wider United Nations system was not effectively involved and pillars of work were not coordinated with the cluster structure. A number of stakeholders at country level also reported that the mission was unwieldy, and said that it took two critical months to establish itself at the height of the epidemic when parts of the existing cluster system could have been used instead\" (WHO, 2015g). 7\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY54\n\nHowever, despite the IHR commitments, many countries fall short. Regional and sub-regional networks, both formal and informal, can play a key role in addressing and mitigating these deficiencies by spreading best practices, providing economies of scale, and improving cross-border cooperation. For example, regional manufacturing and stockpiling of medical products and equipment may be more efficient and practical than national efforts. In a similar vein, health worker shortages in one country might be alleviated by neighboring countries. As discussed in Chapter 3, regional professional registries, laboratory networks, mutual assistance agreements, and preparedness exercises against potential scenarios could complement global approaches, with the advantages of proximity, cultural competency, and epidemiological familiarity.\n\nWhile WHO's regional offices have contributed significantly to outbreak preparedness and control, some neighboring countries find it difficult to work together under WHO structures because they belong to different WHO regions (WHO, 2013). Examples include Thailand and the Mekong Basin countries, Myanmar and China, and Indonesia and Malaysia/Singapore. However, in the past two decades, countries have formed less formal regional or sub-regional networks, such as Southern African Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance in Africa, the Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Southeast Asia, and the Middle East Consortium on Infectious Disease Surveillance in the Middle East. These networks have built trust and developed formal and informal communication flows that enable rapid and continuous communication when outbreaks occur and joint investigations when outbreaks affect border areas. These sub-regional networks should be interwoven with WHO regional offices, which would enable a strong and prompt collaborative response to pandemics.\n\nRecommendation C.5: By the end of 2017, the World Health Organization should work with existing formal and informal regional and sub-regional networks to strengthen linkages and coordination, and thus enhance mutual support and trust, sharing of information and laboratory resources, and joint outbreak investigations among neighboring countries.\n\nNon-State Actors Many non-state actors can and do play significant roles in protecting global health. These actors bring diverse resources, capabilities, and infrastructure. WHO is currently working to fully adopt the Framework for Engaging with Non-State Actors (FENSA) (WHO, 2015i). FENSA is intended to promote engagement among WHO and non-state actors and encourage non-state actors to use their own activities to protect and promote public health. Building on FENSA, WHO CHEPR should actively engage non-state actors, especially local and international civil society organizations, the private sector, and the media.\n\nLocal and International CSOs\n\nAs noted in Chapter 3, local and international CSOs- such as community-based, nongovernmental, and faithbased organizations, as well as academic and research institutions-often have a valuable grasp of the realities on the ground and a vital role to play in ensuring that the perspectives of those directly affected by outbreaks are heard. Working closely with anthropologists with longterm knowledge of affected regions or subject specific knowledge can be a particularly effective way of not only identifying local and regional challenges to containing outbreaks, but also finding locally acceptable and practical solutions to complex issues emerging on the ground. Representatives from civil society could help WHO with reporting of cases, adapting and readjusting approaches during disease outbreaks, realigning priorities, and establishing and disseminating standards, such as those related to research. Moreover, CSOs should be encouraged and supported to play advocacy and watchdog roles at country and global levels. They have demonstrated the ability to bring issues of global and national concern to the forefront, capturing the attention of political leaders and funders, as exemplified in the case of HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS, 2012). WHO should develop protocols and build formal and genuine relationships with local and international civil society groups so that both sides know when and how these actors can contribute most effectively.\n\nPrivate Sector\n\nThe private sector has traditionally provided funding and supplies during emergencies, but private companies have a broad range of other assets, expertise, and capabilities that can augment the public-sector response. The private sector can bring expertise and resources to help with research and development of medical products, transportation of supplies, educational campaigns, construction of treatment units, development and deployment of innovative technology and infrastructure to support responses, logistics and supply chain issues, data management, and financial services (WEF, 2015).\n\nHowever, private-sector players often do not know the best ways to help, so their contributions have often been ad hoc and inconsistent. WHO CHEPR should build relationships with private companies to harness their capabilities in the event of a public health emergency. The key is to define roles and mechanisms for coordination. The private sector must be informed of priorities in order to align its efforts with the UN and WHO, other companies, governments, and other nonstate actors. For example, WHO should engage with airline and trade industries so that their actions align with the IHR as much as possible. With such relationships and alignments in place, companies would know how to contribute effectively and exchange information smoothly with WHO CHEPR and other actors in the event of an outbreak.\n\nMedia The media plays a critical role in communicating to the public about an outbreak. In order to communicate effectively-with the goal of promoting safe behaviors and controlling the spread of the disease-messages must be unified, accurate, evidence-based, well-framed, and timely. The most important aspect of good communication is openness and transparency, which will help gain the trust of the public. When messages are poor, they can create or exacerbate mistrust, generate anxiety, and foster rumors and conspiracies. These outcomes may inadvertently encourage behaviors that make a difficult situation even worse. To prevent this from happening, WHO CHEPR should ensure that it has staff with anthropological, social media, and crisis communication expertise who can work closely with media agencies.\n\nREDESIGNING PROCESSES AND PROTOCOLS WHO should redesign processes and protocols to reinforce the effectiveness of the IHR. In Chapter 3, the Commission recommends that WHO devise a regular independent, transparent, and objective assessment mechanism to evaluate country performance. In this section, we go further to recommend mechanisms that would help ensure that countries report cases and facilitate appropriate international response. We also comment on the type of leadership needed to ensure that such changes are made and sustained.\n\nA High-Priority \"Watch List\" of Outbreaks\n\nOne of the main responsibilities of WHO CHEPR should be to ensure that outbreaks are properly detected and prioritized. Currently, there are some mechanisms in place that aim to fulfill this function. For instance, at national focal points (NFPs), health officials are expected to notify and report potential PHEICs to WHO under the IHR decision instrument for notifications, which member states are required to use. Furthermore, the WHO Global Alert and Response team8 meets each weekday morning to review incoming reports from official and unofficial sources for suspected outbreaks and unknown diseases and for outbreaks undergoing verification and containment. The team then decides on the actions needed for these reports. If a notification has been deemed a potential PHEIC, WHO is expected to provide NFPs with timely updates through a secure event information site (EIS) (WHO, 2008). If a notification is deemed internationally significant,9 the WHO DG convenes an emergency committee of subject-matter experts who provide advice and recommend an evidence-based response. Emergency committees typically make recommendations about whether to declare a PHEIC, but the ultimate decision rests with the DG.\n\nDespite these mechanisms, countries are often reluctant to report novel infections. A major reason is that\n\nThis team includes WHO Country Offices, WHO Sub-Regional Response Teams, WHO Regional Offices, the Alert and Response Operations Centre team in Geneva, and disease specialists (WHO, 2015b). 9 This is based on six main criteria: (1) unknown disease; (2) potential for spread beyond national borders; (3) serious health impact or unexpectedly high rates of illness or death; (4) potential for interference with international travel or trade; (5) strength of national capacity to contain the outbreak; and (6) suspected accidental or deliberate release (WHO, 2015b). 8\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY56 reporting could be seen as failure in the countries' surveillance or the wider global alert and response program (IOM and NRC, 2009). Thus, reporting has implications for national prestige and reputations. Moreover, news of a potential PHEIC can sometimes provoke excessive responses such as travel and trade restrictions, which can adversely impact a state's economy. However, the Commission stresses that it is vital to instill the global norm of early detection and rapid reporting of potential PHEICs. Delayed reporting can cause grave consequences, as some outbreaks need immediate attention to prevent them from becoming epidemics and even pandemics. Prompt alerts enable swift, early, and strong response, which can save lives and money.\n\nTo instill the norm of early reporting and encourage necessary preparedness activities for potential PHEICs, the CHEPR should identify and communicate to NFPs the top priority outbreaks that have the potential to become a threat and need careful monitoring. This \"watch list\" should be drawn from the daily reports the CHEPR receives from official and unofficial sources and should be prioritized based on a rigorous and transparent risk assessment. The CHEPR should communicate the priority watch list through the EIS every day, so that regions and countries could not only see what the CHEPR is monitoring, but also access information to help them ascertain the degree to which interventions and resources should be mobilized. Through this mechanism, alert and response teams at all levels would be better prepared and more easily held accountable. For example, if a highpriority outbreak remained on the list for a while without any response from the affected country, the WHO CHEPR could step in and facilitate technical support as necessary. A summary of this priority watch list should also be made public through the WHO website, perhaps on a weekly basis. We recognize that publishing lists of potential PHEICs might trigger overreaction and public fears. However, if such a list were published every day, it would quickly become normalized and would destigmatize the reporting of outbreaks.\n\nRecommendation C.7: By the end of 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) should establish a mechanism to generate a daily high-priority \"watch list\" of outbreaks with potential to become a Public Health Emergency of International Concern to normalize the process of reporting of outbreaks by coun- try and encourage necessary preparedness activities. WHO should communicate this list to national focal points on a daily basis and provide a public summary on a weekly basis.\n\nProtocols for Holding Governments Publicly Accountable\n\nBecause of the critical consequences of delayed or nonreporting, WHO CHEPR should create a mechanism to hold accountable countries that try to suppress or delay reporting. Countries that share information quickly should be lauded and supported (for example, through budgetary assistance from the IMF, as discussed later in this chapter). Countries that are not transparent and forthcoming in their notifications should be publicly named. In both instances, the WHO weekly epidemiological report should contain details on how a report was obtained and appropriate commendations.\n\nSimilarly, the CHEPR should create protocols to dissuade member states and the private sector from implementing unnecessary restrictions on trade and travel. In past outbreaks, many countries and airline carriers restricted travel, commerce, and trade. Although there are strong political motivations for harsh measures, the IHR create binding legal obligations to act in an evidence-based manner, following WHO's recommendations regarding \"additional measures.\" Travel restrictions can be highly counterproductive. When borders close and commercial flights discontinue, global actors have difficulty providing essential resources to the affected areas, delaying response efforts and sometimes creating an even greater humanitarian and health care emergency ( Heymann et al., 2015). Further, travel restrictions could drive affected patients underground, making it challenging to deliver treatment and potentially allowing the disease to spread more rapidly in the isolated area- eventually putting surrounding areas at even greater risk. It is also worth noting that some borders are difficult to regulate, meaning travel restrictions may not effectively contain the disease. Thus, although travel bans offer an illusion of safety, they also lead to prejudice and stigma around those in affected areas and delays in robust response efforts.\n\nTo prevent travel bans, relevant stakeholders, such as the International Air Transport Association and the World Trade Organization, should be engaged prior to the next outbreak. Strong understanding and communication of the consequences of travel restrictions, as well as cooperation among relevant stakeholders and the public, is crucial. If travel bans are implemented without scientific justification, protocols such as publicly disclosing those countries should be established.\n\nCreating a well-resourced CHEPR, establishing the CFE, and reinforcing coordination and alert mechanisms would enable WHO to be a more effective leader in pandemic preparedness and response. However, the Commission recognizes that strong individual leadership by the DG is also essential. The DG must have the right personal attributes and must be empowered by member states to use them. As the next DG election approaches, member states should carefully consider the leadership qualities that will enable WHO to fulfill its vital role within the global health risk framework. These attributes include: • the ability to reenergize and refocus the organization around its core priorities, making it simultaneously more effective and efficient; • the relationship-building and influencer skills needed to build constructive relationships with other actors, such as other multilateral agencies and nonstate actors; and • the stature and courage to hold their own with other global leaders, to accept accountability, and to hold countries accountable.\n\nFor their part, member states must give the DG the resources and support to enable effective global leadership, even when this entails making tough trade-offs, standing behind unpopular decisions, and calling individual countries to account.\n\nMOBILIZING GLOBAL FINANCIAL\n\nRESOURCES IN RESPONSE TO POTENTIAL PANDEMICS When an infectious disease outbreak has the potential to become an epidemic or pandemic, speed of response is vital. This means mobilizing financial resources swiftly to support the overall response strategy. For many countries, the government's own contingency resources will be the primary source of such funds; however, in situations where challenges overwhelm domestic resource capabilities, international financing support is needed. The experience of Ebola demonstrated that mobilizing such contributions can take time, so it makes sense to have contingency financing arrangements in place to ensure a rapid and effective response. Moreover, the availability of such contingency support arrangements could help to mitigate incentives to delay or suppress alerts at the national level. As discussed earlier in this chapter, WHO's CFE represents one source of such emergency funding, but at $100 million, it is of quite limited scale. To mobilize financial resources of greater scale requires that the World Bank and the IMF also have appropriate arrangements.\n\nAn Emergency Contingency Fund for Pandemic Response\n\nThe Commission welcomes the World Bank's creation of the PEF, because, given the nature of pandemics, it is essential that significant external resourcing can be made available without delay. Although the governments of high-income countries and other donors would undoubtedly respond again to assist a low-income country, the Ebola experience illustrates that mobilizing such resources can take considerable time given considerations such as legislative approval. In our view, the PEF should be the second source of immediate funding from international sources, following quickly on the heels of WHO's CFE. Although there is no precise science to determining the size of the PEF, the figure of $1 billion seems not unreasonable.\n\nIt could be argued that rather than having both a CFE and PEF, there should be only one fund. However, the Commission believes these two funds serve distinct and complementary purposes. The CFE is designed to enable WHO itself to respond quickly and flexibly to outbreaks with pandemic potential. This fund is deliberately discretionary to maximize flexibility and speed of\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY58 response. It is also constrained to funding WHO's activities. The PEF would be triggered less often and with less discretion but would deploy far greater funds to a broad array of accredited responders (including WHO). Merging the CFE and the PEF would limit the DG's flexibility and slow disbursement. Extending the CFE to encompass the greater scale and scope of the PEF would require WHO to fund third parties at a scale it cannot manage. Such funding is already a core function for the World Bank. Creating a separate entity would simply add cost and bureaucracy. That said, it is clearly important that WHO and the World Bank work closely together to optimize the deployment of the CFE and PEF. Indeed, they will also have to coordinate with other contingency funding arrangements within the UN system, such as the CERF.\n\nThe need for the PEF to be available quickly after an outbreak has been identified as having pandemic potential is an important consideration in determining the appropriate financing mechanism. There are a number of options.\n\nOption 1: One-OffCash Contributions or Binding Contingent Commitments from Member States of Other Donors This option has the advantages of immediacy and certainty. Where cash has been contributed, it will be immediately available. Where a commitment is in the form of a binding contingent commitment, the World Bank will be able to raise funds quickly and cost-effectively from the capital markets against that commitment. The disadvantage of this option is that it would require further support from governments of advanced economies and donors, some of whom may not be able to operate on a contingent commitment basis due to constitutional or other legal constraints (although there may be scope to devise near legally-binding contingent commitments, structured so that they can be made binding extremely rapidly). In principle, this approach simply brings forward and makes much more efficient the usual process of calling on advanced economies and other donors when a crisis occurs. However, the political reality of asking governments to contribute or commit substantial sums before a crisis is in sight makes this option quite challenging.\n\nOption 2: Insurance Pandemic insurance is certainly worth pursuing, and considerable progress has been made in developing this option. The key will be whether it will prove cost-effective and practical. To be cost-effective, disaster insurance of this kind typically needs an objective parametric trigger (e.g., an earthquake, or rainfall below a certain amount). Discretionary triggers tend to result in much higher premiums. Given the uncertainties that inevitably surround the early phases of an infectious disease outbreak, this is somewhat problematic. By the time it is objectively clear that a pandemic is taking place (e.g., via a clear impact on mortality data), it may be too late. We are aware that considerable progress has been made in defining and agreeing potential triggers, but the test will be how these work well in practice.\n\nThere are three other issues that need to be considered. Given that life insurers and their reinsurers already bear mortality risk relating to pandemics and hold capital against extreme changes in mortality risk, it can be argued that they should be trying to reduce the extreme mortality risk in their balance sheets. This would suggest they should be prepared to pay for a response mechanism like the PEF that reduces the risk of an outbreak turning into a pandemic, rather than be paid for it. This is the logic underpinning the idea discussed in the next chapter on financing research and development. If insurance regulators were prepared to recognize that financing the PEF would reduce the mortality risk that insurers face, then it might be possible to fund the facility much more cost-effectively. At the very least, these considerations should be factored into the pricing negotiations.\n\nAdditionally, to the extent that insurance premiums are paid by advanced economies and donors on behalf of low-income countries, one must consider whether this is the best use of constrained overseas aid budgets. Paying such premiums might save the advanced economies from having to offer support should a pandemic occur, but would do little to change the reality and the risks for the country itself. It may be better to spend the money on helping to rectify gaps in health system capabilities.\n\nOn the other hand, a clear benefit of using insurance for the PEF is that involvement of the private sector typically drives an intense focus on improving data and can create powerful incentives to mitigate risk-and may ultimately catalyze the development of a private market in pandemic insurance. These dynamics constitute pow- erful arguments for pursuing insurance options. Better data gathering and modeling will certainly contribute to better preparedness. Creating stronger incentives for governments to invest in pandemic preparedness is certainly desirable. However, it should also be noted that incentives are different with pandemics. For other kinds of natural disasters, such as earthquakes or drought, afflicted countries have to rely on altruism when seeking external support. There is no powerful externality. When a potential pandemic occurs, other countries will help out of self-interest, not just altruism-and this means there is less incentive to pay for insurance. The challenge of defining a clear event and the impact of externalities on incentives suggest we may need to be cautious about the prospects of developing a private market in pandemic insurance.\n\nOption 3: Pandemic Bonds Pandemic bonds work almost like pandemic insurance in reverse, but are addressed to different investors. With pandemic insurance, one pays a premium and gets a cash payout if a pandemic occurs. With pandemic bonds, an investor issues a bond in exchange for cash and extinguishes the debt if a pandemic takes place. As with pandemic insurance, the challenge is whether it is possible to identify a trigger that is both objective and early. Extreme mortality bonds, from which pandemic bonds are derived, are triggered by defined changes in mortality. In the case of a pandemic, this trigger would be too late for the purposes of the PEF. As with insurance, for pandemic bonds to be cost-effective as a funding mechanism for the PEF, it will be necessary to identify triggers that are simultaneously parametric and early. We understand that this is precisely what the World Bank and its private-sector partners have been working together to achieve.\n\nAssessing the Options\n\nGiven these considerations, the Commission thinks that Option 1 would be the optimal way to finance the PEF if economic efficiency were the only consideration. However, we acknowledge it will be difficult to secure financial commitments of this magnitude and to overcome the legal constraints on contingent commitments that some governments face. We also recognize the broader benefits of engaging the private sector on data analytics and incentives. If the pricing of the innovative solutions in Options 2 or 3 can be made economically attractive, then it might be possible to combine these options, using funds from Option 1 as the early-release component and funds from Options 2 and 3 somewhat later. With such a combined structure, it would be important to ensure that the pricing of the insurance and bond components reflects the fact that they benefit from the existence of the component of the PEF funded by Option 1.\n\nEmergency Budgetary Assistance\n\nThe WHO CFE and the World Bank PEF are designed to fund emergency response, rather than offset the economic impact of a crisis. The feasibility of developing financial mechanisms to mitigate broader economic impacts on an afflicted country is often discussed, not least because concerns about potential economic consequences can lead governments to delay reporting. However, it is difficult to see how either the insurance industry or capital markets could provide cost-effective mechanisms to achieve this objective, given the potential scale of the impact, the difficulty of establishing objective early triggers, and the degree of perverse incentives.\n\nYet it would make sense for the IMF to consider revising eligibility and triggers for the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) to ensure it is clear that this facility is available to provide budgetary assistance for countries reporting infectious disease outbreaks. The RCF is designed to provide rapid concessional financial assistance with limited conditionality to low-income countries facing an urgent balance-of-payments need (IMF, 2015). The RCF streamlines the IMF's emergency assistance, provides significantly higher levels of concessionality, and can be used flexibly in a wide range of circumstances. While the RCF could not offset the entire economic impact a country facing a potential pandemic, it could help ease the pressure on the government of a low-income country faced with rapidly escalating spending requirements and plummeting tax revenues. Moreover, this could make it clear that declaring an outbreak to have epidemic or pandemic potential might help mitigate the incentives to delay such a decision.\n\nIn addition, although insurance is unlikely to provide\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY60 a complete answer, national governments might want to encourage critical industries to take out appropriate business interruption insurance to mitigate the direct impact on individual firms and thus on the economy as a whole. Levels of business interruption insurance coverage in many countries appear remarkably low (Swiss Re, 2015).\n\nStrengthening international coordination and capabilities is vital to countering the threat of infectious diseases on a global scale. The recent Ebola outbreak revealed significant shortcomings in WHO's operational capacity and leadership, as well as in timely disbursements of funds and resources. To reinforce international coordination and capabilities for outbreak preparedness, alert, and response, WHO should play a leading role in the global system by creating a well-resourced center overseen by a TGB and improving coordination with other global actors, including other UN agencies, regional networks, civil society organizations, and the private sector. There is also a need to redesign protocols to incentivize reporting of outbreaks and encourage necessary preparedness activities. Finally, the development of contingency support arrangements is essential to ensure that a rapid and effective response is not hindered by lack of funds. Global actors together must carry out these critical functions to effectively prepare and respond to major infectious disease outbreaks. The next chapter discusses the need to accelerate R&D to counter the threat of infectious diseases.\n\nANNEX 4-1 Essential Functions for Effective Outbreak Preparedness and Response\n\nGlobal actors must carry out several essential functions for effective outbreak preparedness and response (see Table 4-2). These functions can be divided into three major categories.10 The first overarching category encompasses functions related to the management of externalities across countries to prevent or mitigate deleterious health effects that arise from one country and might affect another. This effort requires strong coordination among stakeholders to ensure timely response to threats that spread across borders. In recent years, the global health landscape has expanded to include multiple actors ranging from national governments, the UN system, multilateral development banks, public-private partnerships, and international and local civil society organizations to the private sector. While these transformations have opened doors to different and innovative resources, coordination of these multiple actors has become particularly important and challenging in responding to a PHEIC. If actors and efforts are uncoordinated and unchecked, competition, duplication, and poor quality tend to emerge.\n\nAnother overarching category is the production of global public goods, particularly knowledge-related goods. In the context of infectious disease outbreaks, examples include defining and evaluating standards for national core capacities and setting priorities for research and development of medical products, among others. This would help global actors work together to achieve common goals in an efficient and accountable way.\n\nFinally, there is a need to mobilize aid to areas where national governments are unwilling or unable to provide protection. For example, when an infectious disease outbreak occurs in a fragile state, financial and resource support will be needed. Even outside fragile states, there may be cases when a country is acutely overwhelmed by a crisis. In these cases, the deployment of emergency response funds and technical cooperation from the inter-\n\nThese categories were adapted from Frenk and Moon, 2013. 10 national community may be needed. At present, there has been conversation about the creation of emergency response funds at WHO and the World Bank, but no mechanisms have been put into place.\n\nIt is important to note that for these functions to perform well, good governance must be observed. Good governance for global health is accountable, transparent, responsive, equitable and inclusive, effective, efficient, and participatory (Gostin, 2014), and should extend from local communities to multinational organizations. However, achieving this ideal can be challenging in the context of infectious diseases because they can evolve into a broader social crises, drawing in political processes and leaders. These officials have the ultimate responsibility for ensuring not only needed health care but also all other services expected of governments before, during, and after crises. Hence, governance for global health needs to integrate a broad array of technical and political inputs. The foundation should be scientific, but the ultimate accountability lies in the political domain. A challenge for the design of systems of governance for global health is to coordinate these accountability functions in such a way that they remain distinct, but are also synergistic. A hierarchy of power and authority needs to be designed such that the best technical advice effectively and efficiently serves the operational and political.\n\nANNEX 4-2 WHO's Strengths and Weaknesses as the Global Leader in Pandemic Prevention and Control\n\nWHO's constitution mandates that it be the global health leader in disease surveillance, outbreak investigation, and response.11 In fact, the primary rationale for establishing WHO in 1948 was to control cross-border infectious diseases. To facilitate the management of PHEICs, WHO may use legal and technical tools to set international norms and guidelines for member states in preventing and responding to potential PHEICs. For The constitution of WHO states clearly WHO's mandate to play key roles in managing PHEICs. See Article 2 for specifics on the roles and responsibilities defined for WHO (WHO, 2006). 11\n\nCHAPTER 4 ANNEX\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY62\n\nCreate system of independent, objective, and transparent assessment of national core capacities, including response plans (akin to GHSA assessment process), so that governments can be held accountable\n\nSet priorities for R&D of medical products Establish standards and agreements for R&D issues (e.g., not nationalizing vaccines during emergencies)\n\nMobilization of global solidarity\n\nProvision of aid, including development financing, technical cooperation, humanitarian assistance, and agency for the dispossessed Provide financial support to low-income countries seeking to enhance national core capacities Provide financial and other resource support for failed states Develop and deploy emergency response funds\n\nNOTE: FAO = Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations; GHSA = Global Health Security Agenda; IHR = International Health Regulations; OIE = World Organisation for Animal Health; PHEIC = Public Health Emergency of International Concern; R&D = research and development; UN = United Nations; WHO = World Health Organization. SOURCE: Framework adapted from Frenk and Moon, 2013. example, the IHR allow WHO to work with affected countries in outbreak investigation, assess the risk, and facilitate timely declaration of the status of the outbreak.12 Additionally, many resolutions developed by the WHA, which convenes health ministers from 194 member states, request WHO to work on PHEICs as well as capacity building for epidemic and pandemic response. These requests show the authority and legitimacy that WHO already holds in this area.\n\nFurther, WHO has social credibility as the leading agency to manage global health issues, especially epidemics and pandemics. Past successes in controlling several high-profile infectious diseases, including plague, smallpox, and malaria, have made WHO a highly socially respected organization when it comes to dealing with disease outbreaks. In 1966, WHO initiated action to carry out a worldwide smallpox eradication program. Historically, the program remains one of the greatest achievements of WHO. Although the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and recent Ebola outbreak may not be good success cases for WHO, it nevertheless continues its role as global health leader.\n\nWHO also has a wide network that allows it to work closely with various actors on outbreak preparedness and response. Within its organization, WHO has an ex-\n\nIn the IHR (2005), Article 13 notes the following: \"(3) At the request of a State Party, WHO shall collaborate in the response to public health risks and other events by providing technical guidance and assistance and by assessing the effectiveness of the control measures in place, including the mobilization of international teams of experts for on-site assistance, when necessary. (4) If WHO, in consultation with the States Parties concerned as provided in Article 12, determines that a public health emergency of international concern is occurring, it may offer, in addition to the support indicated in paragraph 3 of this Article, further assistance to the State Party, including an assessment of the severity of the international risk and the adequacy of control measures. Such collaboration may include the offer to mobilize international assistance in order to support the national authorities in conducting and coordinating on-site assessments. When requested by the State Party, WHO shall provide information supporting such an offer\" (WHO, 2008). Further, in Article 49, it says \"(6) The Director-General shall communicate to States Parties the determination and the termination of a public health emergency of international concern, any health measure taken by the State Party concerned, any temporary recommendation, and the modification, extension and termination of such recommendations, together with the views of the Emergency Committee. The Director-General shall inform conveyance operators through States Parties and the relevant international agencies of such temporary recommendations, including their modification, extension or termination. The Director-General shall subsequently make such information and recommendations available to the general public\" (WHO, 2008). 12 tensive network of 6 regional and 145 country offices. WHO has strong linkages and close collaboration with agencies responsible for preparedness and response in member states, as well as access to thousands of the best public health experts around the world. Additionally, WHO actively engages with various UN mechanisms, which are key drivers in humanitarian crises, including the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the UN Executive Committee on Humanitarian Affairs, the Global Humanitarian Platform, the UN Economic and Social Council, and other initiatives and entities as relevant to play major roles in health cluster-related issues. WHO also engages in dialogue with all stakeholders involved in humanitarian assistance and works to keep health high on the political/ humanitarian agenda. Outside the UN framework, WHO cooperates with a wide network of humanitarian partners worldwide, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement, Collaborating Centers, universities and other academic institutions, CSOs, and senior public health experts. Other key partners are intergovernmental institutions such as the African Union, the Council of Europe, and the International Organization of Civil Protection.\n\nAlthough WHO must lead the effort in outbreak preparedness and control, it currently lacks the organizational capacity to deliver a full emergency public health mechanism (see Table 4-3). With its bureaucratic and vertical structures, WHO cannot perform efficiently. For example, overall coordination among the headquarters and regional offices is poor (WHO, 2013). The separation of humanitarian and outbreak control work has led to confusion and duplication of activities.\n\nAdditionally, WHO predominantly works with the ministries of health for each country, and not as much with other actors. Although it does have channels to work with CSOs and the private sector, coordination and engagement could be improved, especially as the number of actors in the global health landscape increases. Working with other actors is crucial to expand WHO's capacity to manage emergencies and other difficult and complex health problems. Such capacity is becoming more important in the past few decades when health issues have been linked to complex socio-economic and political issues.\n\nPolitical undercurrents influence global health issues. This is not surprising, as health has come to be thought of\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY64 as a tradable commodity (Labonté and Gagnon, 2010). However, politicizing the health discussion in WHO has gradually eroded the most important social asset of the organization-that is, trust among its members. As trust dwindles, it has become more difficult for WHO's networks and member states to work together to fight potential pandemics. There is fear that political influences shroud decisions that are ostensibly based on technical expertise.\n\nFinally, WHO has had limited freedom in how it uses resources. Since the early 1990s, WHO has depended more on voluntary contributions. Voluntary contributions have become its main source of income, accounting for 80 percent or more of its expenses, and are earmarked so that WHO does not have much control over how to use the funds (WHO, 2014).\n\nAs these challenges reveal, WHO's performance in preparedness and response for PHEICs needs improvement. Decisions should be based on rigorous scientific input and shielded from major political interferences. WHO also needs to become more nimble and proactive, breaking down vertical or duplicative structures and providing robust and flexible operational capacity. Finally, an accountability mechanism is needed to evaluate and enhance WHO's performance.\n\nANNEX 4-3 Four Potential Models of Governance for Global Health Security The Commission considered four models of governance for global health security.13 These models are neither mutually exclusive nor exhaustive of all possibilities for global health governance. All of these models recognize that business as usual is not an option.\n\nModel A: A Reformed WHO14 This model assumes that WHO would continue to have operational responsibility for outbreak preparedness and response through improvements of existing structures. Reforms may include distinctly separating technical departments and those dealing with governance; limiting the position of the DG to a single term; modifying the structure and staffing requirements of regional and country offices; and adjusting funding arrangements to ensure that WHO can fulfill core functions. These re-\n\nThese models were presented at the Institute of Medicine Workshop on Governance for Global Health on September 2, 2015. For more information, see http://iom.nationalacademies.org/Activities/ PublicHealth/MicrobialThreats/2015-SEP-01.aspx (Accessed February 1, 2016). 14 This model is based on the Chatham House Working Group on Health Governance's recommendations for reforming WHO (Clift, 2014). 13 forms rely on the member states to be motivated to push for fundamental reform.\n\nModel B: WHO Plus15 This model proposes that WHO would continue to have operational responsibility for outbreak preparedness and response but would significantly revamp its organizational and operational capacity to deliver a complete emergency public health response. To achieve this, WHO would create a center for humanitarian and outbreak management attached to WHO and under the authority of the DG that combines strategic, operational, and tactical capabilities for emergency, humanitarian, and the IHR functions. This center would be designed to respond quickly to different kinds of outbreaks and emergencies. The routine and crisis modes, and the transition between them, would be governed by the center's director, in consultation with the DG, and guided by an independent board in such a way as to create transparency and ensure effectiveness. The center would also strengthen coordination across all three levels of WHO as well as with the UN humanitarian system. In order to support this activity, an increased health security budget within WHO, as well as an increased political commitment from member states, would be required.\n\nModel C: The Executive Agency Model\n\nIn this model, the UN system would create an enabling environment in which WHO, potentially through a center for humanitarian and outbreak management, takes the lead in the health sector and executes a strategic operational and tactical role in a health emergency. This model aims to take advantage of WHO's expertise and legitimacy, while allowing it to tap into the UN's higher level of authority for command and control and political support. This model would be activated only when a multisectoral global response is required to reduce health risk.16 These reforms rely on WHO to formally coordi-\n\nThis model is based on the Ebola Interim Panel's proposal (WHO, 2015g). 16 For example, in cases when an infectious disease is known and the national capacities are fragile, or when the disease is unknown and the national capacities are low, a multisectoral development response would be required within the UN Development Assistance Framework, with WHO taking the lead in the health sector. Alternatively, in cases when the infectious disease is unknown and national capacities are fragile, OCHA would coordinate a multisectoral humanitarian response, with WHO taking the lead in the health cluster ( NASEM, 2016). 15 nate with UN programs and funds under the framework of OCHA and harmonize with NGOs under the IASC framework.\n\nModel D: A New, Separate Entity Under the UN\n\nThis model assumes that the current mandate on global health risks contained in WHO's constitution is either unclear or insufficient and that WHO cannot or should not deal with global health risks. Rather, outbreak preparedness and response measures should be drawn from other UN-system assets and authorities. In effect, the UN would create an interagency entity for global health risks, under the UNSG. This entity would encompass capabilities not only from WHO but also from the FAO, UNICEF, the United Nations Development Programme, World Food Programme, and others.\n\nANNEX 4-4 Models for Reforming WHO's Work on Outbreak Preparedness and Response\n\nSince the Ebola crisis, several initiatives have proposed different types of models for reforming WHO's work on outbreak preparedness and response. Each initiative recognizes that WHO must strengthen its capacity during outbreaks and that the health emergencies and outbreak response functions should merge. Additionally, the initiatives urge better integration of these functions across all three levels of WHO, as well as some kind of oversight mechanism. However, each proposal also suggests different elements for the operational entity's governance and funding structure (see Table 4-4).\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY66\n\nClift, C. 2014.

Crucially, the development of appropriate PPE, pointof-care diagnostics, and a portfolio of novel therapeutic agents, including for antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and vaccine constructs that can be quickly brought to scale, must take place before a crisis strikes, rather than in the midst of an outbreak.\n\nIn parallel, population, policy, and implementation research is needed to understand the population factors, policies, and delivery systems that work best for scaling up interventions to improve the delivery of biomedical interventions ( Jamison et al., 2013). In particular, social research, involving local capacity building where necessary, must be undertaken at vulnerable hotspots to anticipate potential outbreaks, generate vital information about the causes of infection, and develop a body of work that can usefully inform the design and implementation of interventions in future emergencies. It is clear that such a comprehensive approach will only succeed with the contributions of multiple parties working toward common goals.\n\nPandemic Product Development Committee\n\nIn times of global health emergency, the R&D community-academia, government, industry, and civil society-must be galvanized as a cohesive group to swiftly determine the necessary biomedical interventions. For example, in the short term, identification and diagnosis of the pathogen, as well as selection of existing tools to treat and control the infection and curtail AMR,\n\nThe increasing threat of emerging and reemerging infectious disease outbreaks demands research and development (R&D) of effective and fit-for-purpose tools and technologies, such as vaccines, drugs, diagnostics, personal protective equipment (PPE), and medical devices. Recent epidemics have highlighted gaping holes in our ability to rapidly deploy medical products that will not only help identify and contain outbreaks, but also care and treat those affected. To ensure successful resolution of the next major outbreak with minimal loss of life, we must have a more robust R&D strategy.\n\nAccelerating Research and Development to Counter the Threat of Infectious Diseases 5\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY70 are critical. However, it is likely that current technologies will prove insufficient or ineffective, and, therefore, a massive effort to find the needed tools must be undertaken (Balasegaram et al., 2015; Jamison et al., 2013). When there is no pressing emergency, the R&D community has to continue to develop knowledge and have products ready for scale-up and distribution. These activities must be coordinated to ensure effective prioritization, maximize the possibility of success, reduce redundancy and cost, and save lives. However, to date, there are only weak coordinating mechanisms to perform these activities, despite longstanding recognition of this unmet need (CEWG, 2012; CHRD, 1990; CIPIH, 2006). The consequences of the lack of coordination were exposed again in the recent Ebola outbreak, causing confusion about how best to approach and implement response efforts and thereby contributing to inefficiencies (WHO, 2015c).\n\nIn line with its constitutional mandate to direct and coordinate international health work, the World Health Organization (WHO) should galvanize the acceleration of relevant R&D to counter infectious disease threats by establishing a high-level, broad-based expert panel, an independent Pandemic Product Development Committee (PPDC), which would be accountable to the Technical Governing Board, or TGB (see Chapter 4 for more on the TGB). The PPDC would be independent of WHO, and make decisions according to the advice and views of its members, appointed for their technical expertise, not under the direction of WHO. Such a coordinating entity would help fill the unmet need by pinpointing existing capabilities, identifying gaps, and determining priorities for a concerted global effort to develop, test, manufacture, and distribute the relevant medical products in cases of emergency.1 The PPDC should be focused primarily on diseases of pandemic or epidemic potential, including coronaviruses and influenza viruses, among others. The committee's roles and responsibilities should include identifying R&D priorities to tackle high-risk pathogens2 and monitoring the distribution of funds allocated\n\nWHO is in early stages of developing a new R&D Blueprint with similar aims to capture existing knowledge and good practices, identify gaps, and create a roadmap for R&D preparedness, but does not have an entity like the PPDC to take the lead (WHO, 2015a). 2 A panel of scientists and public health experts convened by WHO has developed an initial list of disease priorities needing urgent R&D attention, which will form the \"backbone\" of the new WHO Blueprint for R&D Preparedness (WHO, 2015d). The list of priority diseases includes Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, Ebola virus 1 to the PPDC in line with these priorities. Additionally, the PPDC would be charged with drafting the emergency preparedness plan that outlines R&D roles and responsibilities as part of the overall response. Specifically, this plan would provide a clear roadmap for all willing contributors to the effort, including, but not limited to, identifying existing technologies and best practices; determining \"who does what when\"; selecting and enabling a central emergency point of contact; establishing and implementing a far-reaching, trustworthy communications strategy; and maintaining close contact with on-the-ground responders, governments, industry, scientists, clinicians, and civil society, among others. Domain experts from key stakeholder organizations should be called on to support the many activities the PPDC undertakes, but the PPDC would not be charged with direct management of any specific projects. The TGB should assess the PPDC performance on a yearly basis.\n\nThe Commission recognizes that the PPDC must consider the impact of AMR on preparedness efforts. As we have seen with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis, and other infections, resistance will eventually develop, creating an added challenge for combatting disease and disability. AMR is the by-product of indiscriminate use of antibiotics in the animal industry and human medical practice. Indeed, it is a manmade disaster (IOM, 2010) due to gross misuse of high-quality drugs as well as widespread use of counterfeit antibiotics in many parts of the world. Thus, although the focus of the PPDC must be addressing pandemic threats, the actions it takes can and must be aligned with steps to address resistance. This synergy will serve patients, communities, and countries well.\n\nThe WHO Director-General should appoint the chair of the PPDC and, in collaboration with the chair, appoint the committee members. The chair should be an R&D expert who is also a member of the TGB and would help spearhead resource mobilization. Members should include, at most, 15 internationally recognized leaders who have expertise in discovery, development, regulatory review and approval, and manufacturing of medical products. These experts should be affiliated with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, foundations, academia, research institutions, clinics, and patient disease, Marburg hemorrhagic fever, Lassa fever, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus diseases, and Nipah and Rift Valley fever. and civil society groups.3 The members should serve in their personal capacity in a process that is transparent and balanced. In addition, to ensure impartial decision making, members must disclose any conflicts of interest or potential conflicts of interest before a decision is made on the matter involved, and should be prohibited from voting (other than by offering information) on any decision in which there is a conflict. Information about the members, including those that could be determined to have a potential conflict of interest, should be published on the WHO website.\n\nFurther, a few WHO representatives should participate and provide secretariat support for the PPDC. While the Commission appreciates the complexity of creating and implementing such a group, the clear expectation is that the secretariat would have an enabling role and would be highly sensitive to the importance of ensuring minimal, albeit adequate, spending on administrative infrastructure, thus maximizing the amount of funds devoted to R&D needs. These representatives must have high-level technical expertise and relevant experience in R&D of medical products and possess experience derived from tenure in industry, academia, and/or relevant government agencies.\n\nRecommendation D.1: By the end of 2016, the World Health Organization should establish an independent Pandemic Product Development Committee, accountable to the Technical Governing Board, to galvanize acceleration of research and development, define priorities, and mobilize and allocate resources.\n\nACCELERATING R&D BY INVESTING $1 BILLION PER YEAR\n\nAchieving significant acceleration in R&D related to pandemic and epidemic diseases requires significant amounts of new money. Because it is critical to use the best science to strengthen global defenses against the threat of potential pandemics, the Commission recommends targeting incremental spending of $1 billion4 per year for at least 15 years. Used synergistically with exist-\n\nAlthough WHO has had difficulties in directly engaging with nonstate actors, such as private-sector companies, the Commission believes that with the adoption of the Framework for Engaging with Non-State Actors (FENSA) and Recommendation C.6 (explained in Chapter 4), WHO can take genuine steps to engage non-state actors for this effort. 4 All monetary figures in U.S. dollars. 3 ing and new expenditures in the public and private sectors, these funds would provide a strong foundation for the development and production of an armamentarium of medical tools, including diagnostics, vaccines, drugs, equipment, and techniques, to build and sustain R&D preparedness capacity for rapid response to global infectious disease outbreaks.\n\nThe $1 billion figure can be compared to the scale of a small-medium pharmaceutical company's R&D portfolio of promising drugs and vaccines for key target diseases that are in various stages of development.5 At this size, when there is an outbreak of a known pathogen, much of the early research work would have been completed, and it will then be possible to move some of the products quickly to clinical testing, regulatory approval, production, and deployment.\n\nTo build better defenses against the threat of pandemics, we must step up the pace and scale of R&D on infectious diseases. It is imperative, therefore, to invest in a portfolio of platform technologies and facilities, using public funds where necessary and appropriate and leveraging commercially driven investment where possible. Given the accelerating emergence of new pathogens and the reemergence or geographic spread of previously contained agents, the program must support simultaneous development of multiple platforms. In some cases, it will make sense to take products through to full commercialization; in others, where the threat is more distant, it may be optimal to pause at a certain point, leaving full development and licensing until the threat appears more proximate.\n\nIt is important to note that the PPDC's role should go beyond purely pharmaceutical R&D. The PPDC should shape and oversee an R&D program that encompasses equipment; instruments and tools, such as lowcost diagnostic kits; surveillance systems; and PPE. The PPDC should also help streamline the product development infrastructure required to enable accelerated clinical trials and approvals, as well as promote innovations to enhance manufacturing technology and capacity and deployment systems. However, the PPDC would not deliver the products itself-delivery would be carried out by whomever is allocated the responsibility. The Biomedical\n\nThe $1 billion figure is derived from Commission expertise and does not include a precise number for each product in the portfolio, as the number and types of products fluctuate in any given year, making it unrealistic to make such calculations. 5\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY72\n\nAdvanced Research and Development Authority of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which has experience managing the advanced procurement and development of medical countermeasures for pandemic influenza and other emerging infectious diseases, would be a valuable source of know-how and best practices for the PPDC. The recent Ebola crisis revealed many deficiencies in the global product armory, from diagnostics to vaccines to PPE-and this is for a virus discovered nearly 40 years ago. Only now are we approaching the successful development of an effective vaccine.\n\nIn a sense, we should take an approach akin to that of advanced defense organizations, which anticipate future threats, envision countermeasures, and invest in R&D, both directly and by galvanizing private industry. For example, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) spends $70 billion on R&D (AAAS, 2015). Indeed, reflecting its assessment of future threats to the U.S. population, the DOD has been one of the larger sources of funding for infectious disease research. Comparison with defense R&D also helps put the $1 billion figure in perspective. As we argued in Chapter 2, the global community invests far less in protecting human lives and livelihoods from the threat of infectious diseases than it does in countering other threats, such as wars, terrorism, and financial crises.\n\nBy coordinating incremental R&D investments, we can maximize their impact. We anticipate that the $1 billion would comprise two different components: one portion would come from stakeholders who delegate decision making on deployment of finances to the PPDC, the second from other stakeholders who retain control over the deployment of funds, but work closely with the PPDC to achieve better coordination. Through collaborative shaping and prioritizing of discrete research programs into an overall R&D strategy, the PPDC would help ensure focused efforts in areas of maximum impact across the infectious disease spectrum, not just areas that happen to be commercially viable or fit existing research agendas. The optimal balance between the two components of funding would be determined in detailed discussion with potential contributors.\n\nInvestments in Three Key Areas\n\nThe PPDC, in coordination with other funders, would aim to deploy the funds in the following three key areas: 1. Development and strengthening of core func- tions. These are investments in infrastructure and capabilities needed by all R&D stakeholders, such as high-throughput screening, formulation technology, manufacturing capacity, and building strong local research capacity where outbreaks are likely to occur. 2. Targeted expansion or acceleration of ongoing R&D projects. Recent outbreaks have shown the need to create and test potential new platforms for vaccines and novel drugs past Phase I (safety) trials and primed for Phase II (efficacy) trials once a potential emergency is identified. Investment in and development of platforms already being pursued by government agencies, industry, and foundations would allow a nimble, \"plug and play\" strategy because process development, chemistry, manufacturing, regulatory controls, and analytics would already be in place. Likewise, investments in effective surveillance technologies; point-of-care diagnostics; PPE; medical devices; and population, policy, and implementation research are also strongly needed. Again, expansion or strengthening of existing investments in these areas is paramount. 3. Innovation. Without new scientific knowledge and the synergistic integration of multiple disciplines, new product development and disease-prevention strategies would be impossible. For example, it is imperative to identify new targets for antibiotic development; find ways to potentiate immunological responses; craft strategies to integrate \"omics\" into tool development; develop continuous manufacturing techniques; validate novel clinical trial designs; integrate information and communication technologies into strategies that better track the emergence and diagnosis of global health threats; and discover new platforms that would have broad applicability to identify, prevent, and/or treat infectious diseases with pandemic potential.\n\nTaken together, these three investment areas can produce technologies that are fit-for-purpose and a comprehensive strategy to address threats nimbly and quickly.\n\nSources of Funding\n\nThe Commission envisions that the $1 billion for R&D could be drawn from five potential sources6:\n\nA detailed roadmap on how the funds are mobilized, coordinated, sustained, allocated, and monitored is beyond the scope of this report and will be ultimately up to the PPDC to decide on these 6\n\n1. Direct contributions from national governments, foundations, and the private sector, including private finance from outside the health care sector (see potential source number 5). Such investments have the advantage of leverage and have proven very successful in creating public-private partnerships such as Gavi, the Global Health Innovative Technology Fund, the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development, the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative, and the Medicines for Malaria Venture, among others. 2. From R&D budgets devoted to national security. The role of the DOD, such as through the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency and Defense Threat Reduction Agency, is a model. More countries should recognize that infectious diseases represent significant threats to national security and deploy resources accordingly. 3. From existing public, philanthropic, and university R&D budgets in the health arena, particularly funds for pandemic threats. When combined, these can boost the individual investment capacity and create important synergies. This potential amplification would help address the severe constraints on current budgets. 4. By catalyzing private-sector R&D. Economic drivers enable R&D for infectious diseases for which there is strong market demand-these include, for example, nosocomial infections and yearly flu vaccines. However, sustained private investment for R&D for potential pandemics that may or may not surface or for which testing and licensure is difficult is unlikely. Nevertheless, the private sector has demonstrated a willingness to contribute to the global effort in myriad ways, including through donation programs, by activating R&D capacity in times of crises, and by providing infrastructure support, human resources, and direct funding-making them important contributors to these efforts (WEF, 2015). 5. Generating new sources of private finance from outside the health care sector. All sectors of the mechanisms. The Commission recognizes the challenges in raising this scale of funds proposed and achieving the level of coordination envisaged. However, the Commission believes that accelerating R&D in this arena is of such importance that this is worth trying. economy suffer the consequences of a serious epidemic or pandemic. Therefore, all businesses have a direct interest in supporting tax-funded public spending to mitigate this significant threat. For some types of businesses, there are even more direct connections. For example, the insurance industry faces a significant risk, given the potential impact on mortality; travel and tourism stand to suffer, given the sector's acute vulnerability to restrictions on travel which might be imposed, as well as to voluntary infection avoidance behaviors; and, of course, the meat and poultry trades face the threat of losses due to disease or mandatory culling in the event of an outbreak. One specific example of a novel funding source that could be worth investigating arises from the fact that life insurers hold capital against extreme mortality risk scenarios, among which pandemics are the most likely events. In principle, firms offering life insurance products should be able to reduce their exposure to such risks by funding research, which accelerates the R&D of products that reduce the likelihood of mass mortality pandemic events. If regulators were to approve reductions in reserve requirements faced by such firms due to a lowered risk of pandemic-related mortality, funding such research would appear doubly attractive. Such ideas undoubtedly warrant further exploration.\n\nRecommendation D.2: By the end of 2016, the World Health Organization should work with global research and development stakeholders to catalyze the commitment of $1 billion per year to maintain a portfolio of projects in drugs, vaccines, diagnostics, personal protective equipment, and medical devices coordinated by the Pandemic Product Development Committee.\n\nENSURING CONSISTENT STANDARDS FOR RESEARCH DURING CRISES\n\nWhen a major outbreak occurs, appropriate medical products may be not fully developed or ready for deployment to affected areas. Therefore, there is a strong need to rapidly develop and evaluate investigational therapies during outbreaks, to identify those that benefit patients, and to protect against those that cause harm. To test these therapies and products, researchers have used\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY74 a variety of approaches to conduct studies (Borio et al., 2015). Some of these approaches have led to uninterpretable results and invalid conclusions. Some have also resulted in misunderstandings and suspicion on the part of participants due to poor engagement with communities. In this section, the Commission discusses the need for researchers to conduct scientifically rigorous research studies and to engage locals for studies conducted in community settings.\n\nCommitment to Scientific Standards\n\nThe Commission recognizes the natural tension between the immediate needs of health care workers in the field having to treat the sick and the imperative to conduct trials and studies to ascertain the safety and efficacy of new medical interventions. Society has an obligation to provide immediate help to those in need and to protect health care workers and first responders. But example after example-including the AIDS pandemic, SARS, MERS, and the recent Ebola outbreak-also show that in conducting clinical trials for new vaccines or drugs, society must ensure that in all instances, particularly during health emergencies, these studies are scientifically sound and justifiable and yield interpretable data and strong, valid conclusions.\n\nResearchers must conduct trials under rigorous scientific and ethical principles. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) offer robust methodology with low probability of bias or confounding. RCTs also best utilize the limited number of experimental interventions by obtaining the most valid and reliable results for the benefit of current and future patients (Kalil, 2015). If data are poor and controls are weak or nonexistent, information about how experimental products may be helping or harming current patients remains unknown, offering no benefit to future patients and potentially causing harm.\n\nDifferent and innovative trial designs can be-and are-employed to allow for interpretable, scientifically sound results. For vaccines, two examples of such trial design include the immediate-versus-delayed-vaccination and \"ring\" vaccination trials, which were conducted in Sierra Leone and Guinea, respectively, during the Ebola outbreak (WHO, 2015b). For therapeutics, the National Institutes of Health's (NIH's) medical countermeasures study contains multiple intervention arms with just one placebo (i.e., standard-of-care) group. This \"adaptive\" design allows trial arms to stop early where there is demonstrated toxicity or lack of efficacy (Borio et al., 2015). During public health emergencies, these adaptive trial designs may help balance the need for scientifically valid information and rapid results. However, no trial will benefit the public if data and results are not shared in a timely manner so that they can be reviewed and validated by external investigators and regulators. Therefore, regardless of the trial design, data and results of all trials must be shared promptly and transparently.\n\nTo conduct these trials, a strong local clinical trial infrastructure is paramount. Unfortunately, in many resource-poor countries, particularly in hotspots for emerging infectious diseases, trained staff, appropriate technical support, and adequate physical facilities are completely lacking-hampering the swift movement of potentially useful products from Phase I or Phase II into Phase III trials. Preparedness for trials requires appropriate physical infrastructure, a trained health care workforce, established and functional ethics committees, expertise in social sciences, community mobilization, and sustainable basic public health capacity, such as surveillance and basic laboratories. This takes time and resources. If we are to be ready for the next outbreak, we need to assess the current research and public health capacities of vulnerable areas and invest in building this infrastructure. The PPDC could provide guidance on the funding and delivery mechanisms of such an effort.\n\nEngaging Communities in Research\n\nWhen researchers design and conduct studies in community settings, strong local engagement and buy-in is imperative at every step along the way. Involving local people, particularly key opinion leaders and scientists, is of critical importance; in many communities, for example, local healers as well as religious and peer leaders are enormously influential (Awunyo-Akaba, 2015). Open, bilateral, or multilateral information exchange from the outset will create trust, promote discussion, help address local concerns or misperceptions, and ensure that study participants are treated with utmost respect and consideration.\n\nAs researchers seek to enroll participants in studies, care must be taken to ensure that participants are fully informed and educated about all aspects of the protocol. This process is not always straightforward (Geissler and Molyneux, 2011; Parker and Allen, 2013), but it is essential. Informing study participants necessarily requires proficiency in the local language, regular dialogue with study participants, meetings with experienced local scientific investigators, and an understanding of the way in which the political reality shapes participation at the local level (Sow, 2015). Every effort should be made to inform local leaders, as well as civil society groups, about the science of the disease and the rationale underpinning the design of the particular clinical trial. Such an approach is not only invaluable in itself-it also helps to mitigate rumors and misunderstanding.\n\nA program run by the Kenya Medical Research Institute-Wellcome Trust Research Programme usefully illustrates the way in which study participants in international health research acquire relevant knowledge before consenting to participation in a trial. This program engages local community facilitators, health care professionals, and local people to create consent forms that are socially and culturally sensitive to local needs (Boga et al., 2011). By bringing together community stakeholders, the initiative confronts concerns about research head-on and incorporates potential solutions into the consent process. Concerns can range from understanding of controls and placebos to sample storage and use, among other scientific or process-based issues (Boga et al., 2011).\n\nThe emphasis on creating and maintaining open dialogue between those doing the research and those participating in the study is critical. Under its Communication for Development initiative, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) encourages social mobilization as an effective approach to informing communities. This approach brings together local stakeholders to learn about particularly relevant issues through open dialogue (UNICEF, 2015). Opening up a conversation allows researchers to address local anxieties and fears, alter their messaging accordingly, and ensure that people truly understand the purpose of the research.\n\nEven if there are effective medical products available following the conclusion of a study, the products are useless if they are received with suspicion, rejected by those residing in affected areas, and ultimately not adopted for use. Widespread fear and anxiety, occasionally leading to violent rejection of mass drug administration for control of neglected tropical diseases, as in the case of schistosomiasis (Hastings, 2016; Muhumuza et al., 2015; Parker et al., 2008) and lymphatic filariasis (Kisoka et al., 2015; Parker and Allen, 2013), usefully illustrates this point. Thus, researchers must establish and maintain relationships with local individuals to effectively move a study or product forward. Further, strong communication must be matched with successful service delivery to be effective. In order to achieve this, researchers and product developers must engage local logistics support, supply chain experts, and those with knowledge of the specific social contexts in which supplies will be delivered and dispensed (Hall, 2015).\n\nSECURING OVERARCHING GLOBAL AGREEMENTS TO EXPEDITE APPROVAL, MANUFACTURE, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\nUnder the coordinating leadership of the PPDC, R&D stakeholders should pre-negotiate global agreements to facilitate timely and appropriate implementation and distribution of a range of tools and infrastructure during a global infectious disease outbreak. Without agreement on regulatory approval and review, manufacturing and distribution mechanisms, indemnification, IP and data sharing, to name a few, effective medical products may not reach those in need.7\n\nConvergence of Regulatory Processes and Regulatory Science Standards\n\nRegulatory agencies must continue to work toward common rules, agree on best practices, and establish standards that will define how products for emergencies are reviewed and approved. Currently, each country has its own distinct processes of reviewing and approving the safety, efficacy, and quality of medical products. Understanding and navigating the diverse regulatory systems can be cumbersome and complex, causing delays in deploying products to patients. A streamlined process across regulatory systems would lead to important efficiencies.\n\nThe problem of discordant regulatory systems was illustrated during the H1N1 outbreak, when each country's national regulatory authority-understandably- imposed its own regulatory process for approving, authorizing the importation, and overseeing the distribution of vaccines. Processes ranged from one-time waivers of certain rules to detailed requirements for pediatric subgroup data, regulatory assessments capacity, quality\n\nThe Commission recognizes that the following section does not lay out an exhaustive roadmap of how to achieve these agreements. Such a roadmap requires extensive discussion and analysis among various stakeholders and is beyond the scope of this report. 7\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY76 control preparedness and capacity, and post-marketing safety surveillance and field assessment of efficacy and immunogenicity (Halabi, 2015). Additionally, in over half of the beneficiary countries, prequalification of a vaccine by WHO was not sufficient to obtain regulatory approval, while in others, albeit relatively few, national laws stated that products donated by the UN did not require national registration (WHO, 2010). The distinct requirements that varied across countries adversely affected efficacious donation and distribution, as it took time for manufacturers and other entities to access, understand, and sift through the information on the countries' regulatory processes and negotiate with regulators.\n\nRegulatory convergence does not require nations to give up their autonomy, but rather helps them come together quickly to address the following questions: How can countries divide the tasks associated with a product review and work together to ensure that prescribing information is aligned? How can regulators align expectations of what is required in regulatory submissions for product review and approval? How can they move toward more common data and evidence standards? What are the knowledge base and the regulatory tools necessary for more streamlined oversight?\n\nSome steps have been taken to achieve better regulatory convergence. In the most recent Ebola outbreak, regulators from around the world, including Health Canada, the United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the European Medicines Agency, worked together with local regulators to speed preparation for trials in West Africa (EMA, 2014; WHO, 2015c). Another example is the International Coalition of Medical Regulatory Authorities (ICMRA), which is a voluntary, executive-level entity that provides direction for a range of areas that are common to many regulatory authorities' missions (Skerritt et al., 2015). While ICMRA is still in its nascent stages, it may be a promising example in regulatory convergence, alignment, and standards development.\n\nPre-Approval of Clinical Trial Designs and Master Protocols\n\nR&D stakeholders should discuss and agree on the different possible designs for clinical trials and protocols that are scientifically valid and appropriate for emerging infectious diseases. This would expedite the evaluation of investigational products during emergencies and allow therapies shown to be safe and effective to reach patients more quickly.\n\nCurrently, the process of approving clinical trial designs and protocols during an outbreak is not streamlined. This was apparent during the recent Ebola outbreak, when researchers worldwide diverged on the types of clinical trials to undertake and wrote protocols that took time to be approved in the three affected West African countries (WHO, 2015c).\n\nThe process of testing an investigational product would be more efficient if research clinical designs and protocols that took account of uncertainty were outlined and approved prior to emergencies and then adapted to the specific outbreak. Pre-approved clinical designs have been used successfully, such as when Médecins Sans Frontières assessed the validity of new rapid diagnostic tests during a meningitis outbreak, which reported no harm to participants and enhanced the ability of researchers to respond in a timely manner (Schopper et al., 2015). A move toward common protocols (Borio et al., 2015) and sharing designs and protocols broadly within the research community would allow researchers to be ready to test investigational products at the onset of a crisis. The International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium, which provides a platform for researchers to share and download research protocols and data tools useful in epidemics, could help facilitate the pre-approval process and sharing of protocols (ISARIC, 2015).\n\nMechanisms for Managing Intellectual Property and Sharing of Data and Reagents\n\nTransparent mechanisms for managing IP and sharing of data and materials are needed for efficient R&D processes during major outbreaks. Withholding valuable information, including negative results, is a disservice to the R&D effort; such behavior delays progress in the fight against the pandemic, wastes time and resources, and stifles collaboration (Heymann et al., 2015).\n\nAn example of a mechanism to streamline activities is WHO's Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework, which seeks to improve and strengthen the sharing of influenza viruses with human pandemic potential (WHO, 2011). This requires manufacturers to agree on a standard material transfer agreement that regulates the terms under which countries agree to donate influenza samples, the entities authorized to receive and research them, and the corresponding sharing of resulting vaccines and other IP. This framework oversees the sharing of H5N1 and other influenza viruses with human pandemic potential, but does not apply to non-influenza biological materials. This type of framework of sharing specimens could be expanded to other threats.\n\nLikewise, data and other information related to R&D should be made available in a public domain to avoid duplicative costs and wasted effort. There are examples, such as GlaxoSmithKline's data transparency model,8 the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health,9 and the Biomarkers Consortium,10 that have made important strides to ensure that information is promptly available to the public. In addition, the NIH, the U.S. National Science Foundation, The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Wellcome Trust, among others, have established guidelines for data sharing by grantees. These models should to be expanded to make data sharing and speedy publication the norm.\n\nReasonable Protection Against Product Liability Claims\n\nStakeholders must agree on the degree to which manufacturers should be indemnified against liability claims during an emergency. Without realistic protection, many manufacturers will halt the production of medical products, and patients will not receive timely proper care or treatment.\n\nExperience has shown that manufacturers require protection. During the H1N1 outbreak, for example, vaccine manufacturers required that all purchasers or recipients indemnify them for adverse events resulting from use of the vaccine, unless the failure was due to discrete manufacturing specifications (Halabi, 2015). In other cases, some manufacturers will not authorize the use of a vaccine for a clinical trial if they are not insured against legal liabilities or in the absence of clear agreements for protection. Even in situations where a manufacturer agrees in principle to donate to WHO or other UN agencies to protect from potential liability claims, it might not do so in certain countries if such vaccine is not duly licensed (GAO, 2008). Other legal barriers include For more information, see http://www.gsk.com/en-gb/behind-thescience/innovation/data-transparency (accessed March 24, 2016). 9 For more information, see https://genomicsandhealth.org (accessed March 24, 2016). 10 For more information, see http://www.biomarkersconsortium.org (accessed March 24, 2016). 8 those related to preexisting advance market commitment agreements, which affect the ability to enter into additional contracts once a pandemic has been declared, or those related to approval and registration procedures with national regulatory authorities (Halabi, 2015).\n\nIdentification and Contracting Manufacturing Platforms and Facilities\n\nThe PPDC should establish mechanisms to quickly identify and contract manufacturing platforms and facilities before and during a crisis. Such manufacturing capacity is not widely available, particularly in developing countries. Only a few areas of the world, such as Australia, Europe, Japan, and North America, have plants for manufacturing influenza vaccine (Halabi, 2015). In fact, the capacity for vaccine production is severely limited compared with the number of doses that would be required for a future pandemic.\n\nManufacturing takes time, resources, and expertise; different facilities are needed for different products. Therefore, accurate and detailed information on capabilities and output yields is crucial so that, in the event of a pandemic, R&D stakeholders will know if and when they can contribute to scale-up, how to produce the greatest possible quantity of medical products in a timely manner, and when and how to scale down safely after the threat disappears. Demand forecasting and clarification of stockpiling plans are also important in ensuring adequate production of drugs and vaccines. Spare manufacturing capacities may be needed to accommodate mass manufacturing of products, as well as testing investigational products. For example, GlaxoSmithKline has plans to share a manufacturing site where the scientific and pharmaceutical communities can come together to draw expertise and knowledge from the facility-from vaccine design through manufacturing (GSK, 2015).\n\nIf adequate manufacturing capacity is unavailable in an affected country, regional manufacturing and stockpiles could facilitate production and distribution of medical products to populations in need. In fact, specific centralized production facilities in countries with capable regulatory authorities and a track record for high-quality standards may be preferable in some areas for ensuring public health benefit in terms of quality, timelines, economies of scale, and affordability. These locations should be determined prior to an emergency. Indeed, it is reasonable to assume that attempting to build manufacturing and distribution infrastructure during an\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY78 emergency will not yield best results-far from it. Taking guidance from national defense-enterprise preparedness strategies, the PPDC should consider finding ways to maintain a geographically distributed \"warm industrial base\" that is primed for quick scale-up of medical product manufacturing, deployment, and delivery where such products are most needed.\n\nAccess and Distribution of Stockpiles of Vaccines, to Reach Those at Greatest Risk\n\nA global access framework should be developed to ensure that the right drug is delivered to the right place and population at the right time. As noted before, the sobering truth is that there is limited capacity for producing potentially lifesaving vaccines, and not everyone is able to get needed medical products at the same time (Yamada, 2009). This requires difficult decisions about who gets the medical products first.\n\nThe ability to pay should not determine where products are distributed, as in the case of a country that wishes to stockpile vaccines for its low-risk population. Rather, those who are at the greatest risk and in imminent danger during a crisis-whether they are frontline health workers or a vulnerable local population-should have priority. This means that, in order to ensure equitable access and distribution of vaccines to those in need, countries must refrain from nationalizing their vaccine manufacturing output. This was illustrated during the H1N1 outbreak in 2009, when governments with preexisting contracts sought to preserve the capacity of firms located within their territorial borders to inoculate their own citizens before giving or selling to other countries (Fidler, 2010). The rationale, which is understandable, was that the governments had an obligation to their citizens before exporting vaccines to other populations. However, the reality was that these populations were at very low risk and the prioritization was incongruent with good public health policy.\n\nTo ensure access, a process for stockpiling supplies of premanufactured material should be developed. In addition, prices need to be such that the most vulnerable people, who tend to be the poor, can afford the medical products. Contributions from high-income countries to offset the cost of vaccines for countries and populations who cannot afford to pay for them is critical, as are tiered pricing schemes, donations, and other mechanisms that can ensure access to prevention, care, and treatment.\n\nIt should be self-evident that scientific research must play a critical role in the global framework for countering the threat of infectious diseases. Yet to be able to react promptly to outbreaks with the potential to become pandemics by deploying new medicines, diagnostic tools, and instruments at pace, we need more R&D in this arena, and we need it to be better coordinated. To achieve this, the Commission recommends that WHO establish a dedicated entity, the PPDC, to define priorities, mobilize and allocate resources, and oversee progress. We recommend targeting incremental R&D spending of $1 billion per year, to be coordinated by the PPDC. This proposed budget does not include expenditures for AMR, although it is expected that innovative drugs supported by the PPDC may help address AMR. The Commission also recommends a number of actions to ensure that R&D during crises sustains the highest scientific standards, that communities are effectively engaged in R&D processes, and that many of the impediments to swift development, approval, and deployment of new medical products are tackled in advance.\n\nAAAS (American Association for the Advancement of Science).\n\n2015.

New England Journal of Medicine 361:1129-1131.\n\nThe next potential pandemic may be far more contagious and far more fatal. So, while the memories of Ebola are fresh-and we should not forget that the epidemic is not yet over-we should grasp the opportunity to shore up our defenses. We must create a global health risk framework capable of protecting human lives and livelihoods worldwide from the threat of infectious disease. We have neglected this aspect of global security for far too long.\n\nFirst, we must recognize the scale of the risk. As we argued in Chapter 2, infectious diseases represent a massive threat to human life and economic well-being. Given the increasing rate of emergence of new infectious diseases and the increasing inter-connectivity of people and economic activity, the underlying risks and potential impact are probably increasing. We need to understand and counter the risks across the whole spectrum of infectious diseases-from emergence and outbreak to epidemics and, ultimately, pandemics. Second, we must acknowledge the degree to which we have neglected this risk. Compared with other threats to human security or economic security, such as war, terrorism, or financial crises, we have devoted far less resources to countering the threat of potential pandemics. We are underinvested and underprepared in almost every dimension, from national capacities and infrastructure to global capabilities and coordination to product research and development.\n\nCreating a resilient framework that better protects humankind will require determined leadership. As we set out in Chapters 4 and 5, it will require leadership at the global level to make WHO much more effective, to enhance the role of the multilaterals and the United Nations in this arena, and to mobilize the funds required to improve the core capacities of poorer countries and accelerate research and development (R&D). As we outlined in Chapter 3, it will require leadership at the national government level to build and sustain effective public health infrastructure and capabilities as core foundation of the overall health system. If ensuring the security of the public is the first duty of a government, then protecting against infectious disease is a security imperative.\n\nCreating this framework will also require money. We believe the global community should commit to spend about $4.5 billion1 per year to rectify deficiencies in local health systems, enhance global capabilities and coordination, and accelerate R&D. This is not a small sum, but compared with the cost of potential pandemics, and compared with what we spend on other risks, The world needs a stronger, more resilient framework for global health security. The Ebola crisis revealed deficiencies in almost every aspect of how we defend humankind against the threat of infectious diseases. Disease surveillance was inadequate, and outbreak alerts were slow. Local health systems were quickly overwhelmed. Local communities lost trust. The World Health Organization (WHO) was slow to respond and lacked capabilities and resources. The broader international response took too long and was poorly coordinated. There were gaps and shortfalls in diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, and protective equipment; there were inadequacies in logistics, communications, and governance. Ultimately, we will contain Ebola, but at far too great a cost in lives, resources, and economic disruption.\n\nBuilding a Framework for Global Health Security 6\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY82 the investment case is certainly compelling. Moreover, the framework we propose will yield benefits beyond countering the threat of infectious diseases. More resilient local health systems and a more effective global health architecture will also fortify against other pressing global health challenges, such as antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and endemic diseases like malaria.\n\nInfectious diseases represent an enormous threat to humankind. Few other events can kill as many people or destroy an economy so quickly. We have neglected this risk. Our ability to identify, prevent, and respond to potential pandemics is full of flaws and weaknesses. Yet this is a solvable problem. With leadership and a commitment of roughly $4.5 billion per year, we can make the world much safer.\n\nIn this chapter, we gather the threads of the financing discussion to show how the figure of $4.5 billion is derived and how it could be sourced. We then close with a brief discussion of what should happen next.\n\nTHE OVERALL FINANCING CHALLENGE\n\nTo make the world much safer from the threat of pandemics, the global community should commit to investing roughly $4.5 billion per year in prevention, detection, and preparedness efforts, including research and development. Put differently, for an annual investment of approximately 65 cents per person, we could substantially improve our defenses against one of the biggest threats facing humankind.\n\nTo arrive at the figure of $4.5 billion in required incremental funding, we aggregated four components: 1. The upper end of the World Bank's 2012 estimated range of $1.9-$3.4 billion for the cost of upgrading national pandemic preparedness capabilities (World Bank, 2012). 2. Our proposed figure of $1 billion per year for infectious disease prevention and response R&D (see Chapter 5). 3. A 5 percent increase in the WHO core assessment to fund the Center for Health Emergency Preparedness and Response (CHEPR), which would amount to approximately $25 million per year (see Chapter 4). 4. A stylized funding cost of WHO's Contingency Fund for Emergencies (CFE) of roughly 25-30 percent, which assumes net funding costs of 2 percent and full drawdown on a non-repayment basis, plus subsequent replenishment of the fund every 4 years. For the proposed contingency fund of $100 million, this amounts to about $25-$30 million per year.2 5. A stylized funding cost of the World Bank's Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (PEF) of 8-10 percent, based on an effective net funding cost of 2 percent plus annualized deployment costs of 6-8 percent, assuming that PEF loans are made as a mixture of concessionary loans and grants every 4 years; or, alternatively, that the PEF is funded through an insurance mechanism with premiums around this level. For the proposed PEF of $1 billion, this amounts to about $80-$100 million per year.3\n\nThe amount of incremental spending proposed is not precise, for four principal reasons.\n\nFirst, we do not have a robust assessment of the gaps in national core capacities for infectious disease prevention and detection. The World Bank's 2012 estimate of $1.9-$3.4 billion was the result of a very extensive process of consultation and data gathering around what would be needed to upgrade low- and middle-income countries' capacities to the level required to be compliant with International Health Regulations (IHR) (World Bank, 2012). This is obviously quite a wide range, and it excludes any upgrading that might be required in more advanced economies, as well as investments in health systems that extend beyond those strictly required by the IHR guidelines. It also excludes increases in relevant spending at a national level since 2012, including the international response to the Ebola epidemic and the Global Health Security Agenda.\n\nAnnualized funding costs for the CFE and PEF were calculated using the following assumptions. For the CFE, net funding costs were estimated at 2 percent (calculated as 3 percent minus 1 percent yield on undeployed funds), and all funds were assumed to be spent in year 4. Thus, over a 4-year cycle, a $100 million contingency fund would cost 100 × .02 × 4 = $8 million. Further, assuming that the full $100 million is spent over a 4-year cycle, this brings the total to $108 million, annualized as $27 million. 3 For the PEF, net funding costs were again estimated at 2 percent, and the full amount of the fund ($1 billion) was assumed to be loaned out every 4 years, for 1 year (i.e., to year 5). Thus, the funding cost over 5 years for the PEF is 1,000 × .02 × 5 = $100 million. Note that this approach treats money loaned in year 5 as new money, because the first tranche will be deployed at end of year 4. Additionally, we deduct the return on investment for the year in which the funds are disbursed, adding 1,000 × .03 × 1 = $30 million. Finally, we allow for 25-35 percent of the value of the $1 billion fund being written off every time it is deployed, totalling $250-$350 million. These inputs give a 5-year cost of $380-$480 million, annualized to $74-$96 million. 2\n\nSecond, much of the incremental spending on national health systems relates to capabilities and infrastructure (such as laboratory networks and surveillance tools) that are also required to mount an effective response to other health issues, such as AMR and endemic diseases like malaria. As a consequence, the World Bank's estimate of the cost of upgrading health systems capabilities effectively double-counts the cost of some components.\n\nThird, some elements of the incremental spending proposed are necessarily subjective, with a large element of uncertainty in their determination. This is most obvious with the proposals for incremental expenditure on the R&D component. We are confident that it makes sense to spend more than is currently being allotted to product R&D in the infectious disease arena, and that the increase in expenditure would have to be substantial in order to make any meaningful difference. However, there is clearly no formula that converts a quantum of incremental investment into specific product outcomes with certainty. That said, comparison with other publicly funded R&D efforts suggests that our figure of $1 billion is not unreasonable. For example, global funding for HIV prevention research was $1.25 billion as of 2014 (RTWG, 2015).\n\nFinally, the cost of the WHO contingency fund and the World Bank PEF depend on the financing structure, how often they are utilized (and subsequently replenished), and whether the funds are deployed as loans or grants. As a result of this uncertainty, we have made stylized estimates of their annualized costs to enable us to create an overall aggregate figure for the cost of these funding facilities. However, when compared with our proposals for annual spending on health systems strengthening and R&D, these numbers are relatively small contributors to the overall cost figure. As a result, the impact of this uncertainty on the total will be small.\n\nThese considerations and caveats notwithstanding, providing an indicative single overall figure-$4.5 billion per year-gives a sense of the scale of the financing challenge. Moreover, this number is grounded in current best evidence as to the costs of health systems improvement and is comparable to other R&D efforts of comparable scale.\n\nThere are good reasons to believe that investment to reduce the global threat posed by pandemics represents exceptional value for money, when health and economic returns on investment are considered. Analysis of the re- sponse to the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone highlights the health gains that come from being able to respond more rapidly to infectious disease outbreaks. A recent study found that international support to Sierra Leone helped avert more than 50,000 cases of Ebola, with the potential to avert a further 12,500 had this support been mobilized 1 month earlier (Kucharski et al., 2015). Considering only the benefits to economic growth (rather than human life), estimates by the World Bank suggest that investment to strengthen national health systems to IHR standards would yield a positive return on investment in all plausible scenarios (World Bank, 2012). Likewise, swift deployment of funds to fight an outbreak can yield extraordinary returns. For example, Nigeria spent approximately $13 million responding to the Ebola outbreak, and, while Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone each lost several percentage points of gross domestic product (GDP) as a result of Ebola, Nigeria suffered minimal economic losses (World Bank, 2014). A 2 percent reduction in Nigeria's 2014 GDP would have translated to an economic loss of nearly $12 billion (World Bank, 2015).\n\nSet against the scale of the threat to lives and the global economy, there is a compelling case for investing the incremental $4.5 billion per year we propose to prevent, detect, and better prepare to respond to pandemics. Even if the investments we recommend were to reduce our estimate of the expected economic loss from pandemics of more than $60 billion by only 10 percent, which seems extremely conservative, spending $4.5 billion per year would reduce expected losses by more than $6 billion. Moreover, as argued earlier, these investments would also contribute to the achievement of other health goals, such as countering the threat of AMR and containing endemic diseases like malaria and tuberculosis.\n\nSet in contrast to what the world spends on other risks to human lives and livelihoods, the case gets even stronger. As we pointed out in Chapter 2, the risk is not that that we will spend too much; the risk is that we will continue to spend too little-with potentially disastrous consequences.\n\nIn the rest of this section, we briefly summarize the approach to determining each of these five components of expenditure and present potential funding options.\n\nFinancing Stronger National Core Capacities\n\nIn Chapter 3, we argued that reinforcing core capacities and infrastructure at the national level so that countries\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY84 are better able to prevent infectious disease outbreaks (or detect outbreaks and respond before they escalate to the level of an epidemic or pandemic) is a top priority. Doing so will require significant incremental expenditure and is the largest component of our recommendations.\n\nAs explained in Chapter 3, estimating the scale of the required incremental investment is difficult, because information about each country's current status is far from perfect and benchmark definition is insufficiently precise. The best analysis of the costs of reinforcing national capabilities and infrastructure to achieve IHR compliance stems from a World Bank (2012) study, People, Pathogens and Our Planet. This study concluded that achieving compliance for low- and middle-income countries would cost $1.9-$3.4 billion per year.\n\nIn considering how to meet this gap, a key requirement is sustainability. Health systems resilience is an ongoing commitment, not a one-off effort. Moreover, given that it is the foundation of health security, spending on public health infrastructure and capabilities should be seen as a central component of national security expenditures, an integral part of a government's fundamental duty to protect its people. As set out in Chapter 3, we therefore recommend: • High-income and upper-middle-income countries must make achievement of the IHR core capacities a core part of the government's expenditure. Civil society can hold governments accountable through the mechanism of independent assessment described in Chapter 3. Such countries should also establish emergency contingency funds. • Lower-middle-income and low-income countries should determine, in dialogue with multilateral and bilateral partners, the appropriate balance of domestic resource mobilization and external support (which might be directed at helping upgrade capabilities and infrastructure, contingent on local governments' commitments to maintain support thereafter). The World Bank should work with other multilaterals and bilateral donors to catalyze and coordinate such support. • For fragile and failed states, the UN, the World Bank, and WHO should work together to determine appropriate strategies for sustaining health systems infrastructure and capabilities to the extent possible.\n\nAcross all countries, incremental investment in health systems should be guided by: • a clear definition of the core capacities required (as set out in Recommendation B.1); • rigorous, objective, and transparent assessment of current performance against these defined capacities (as envisioned in Recommendation B.2); and • clear and detailed plans to rectify gaps, including the costs of upgrading core capacities and a model for fulfilling the funding needs (as required by Recommendation B.6).\n\nFunding Stronger Global Coordination, Preparedness, and Response\n\nIn Chapter 4, we argued that, in addition to reinforcing national capabilities and infrastructure, it is necessary to strengthen regional and global capacities to enable better coordination and response. Among other things, we recommend the formation of the WHO CHEPR and support the establishment of the WHO CFE and the World Bank's PEF. These three elements require the following incremental financing: • WHO CHEPR: Although the discussion around\n\nWHO's core funding involves considerations beyond the remit of this Commission, we recommend that the CHEPR be financed through an increment to assessed contribution, rather than via voluntary contributions, because we see the CHEPR as essential to WHO's fulfillment of a core part of its mandate. We have not sought to develop an independent estimate of the incremental funding requirement for the CHEPR, but have taken as an estimate the 5 percent figure suggested by the Report of the Ebola Interim Assessment Panel (WHO, 2015a) and consistent with the additional funding for \"preparedness, surveillance and response\" in WHO's Proposed Programme Budget for 2016-2017 (WHO, 2015b). This amounts to about $25 million per year. • WHO CFE: We support the creation of WHO's CFE as a highly flexible, immediately available fund of $100 million. As outlined in Chapter 4, we believe the most appropriate way of funding the CFE would be through one-off initial contributions, assessed pro rata with the core assessed contributions, in the form of either actual cash contributions or binding contingent commitments.\n\n• World Bank PEF: We also support the creation of the World Bank's PEF of $1 billion. As with WHO's CFE, we see binding contingent commitments as being the most cost-effective way of funding this facility, although we recognize that such mechanisms can pose problems for some partner governments. Innovative insurance and capital market solutions could be attractive, if demonstrated to be economic and practical.\n\nFinancing Accelerated Product Research, Development, and Delivery\n\nIn Chapter 5, the Commission recommends targeting incremental spending of $1 billion per year to reinforce the global ability to respond to infectious disease threats through science. The objectives are to enhance our capacity to detect infectious disease outbreaks through better diagnostics, strengthen our ability to control such outbreaks through better containment and protection tools, and accelerate our ability to respond through faster development and deployment of vaccines and therapeutics. This differs from conventional pharmaceutical R&D, in a number of ways: • It includes equipment, instruments, and tools, such as low-cost diagnostic kits, surveillance systems, protective equipment, and delivery mechanisms. • It incorporates investment and innovation in product development infrastructure to facilitate accelerated clinical trials and approval processes. • It encompasses sustainment of flexible manufacturing capacity and deployment mechanisms, because rapid scale-up of vaccine manufacture and quick delivery to the field are likely to be critical.\n\nThe figure of $1 billion is indicative rather than precise. The scope and priorities of the overall program will have to be defined by the Pandemic Product Development Committee (PPDC) we describe in Chapter 5. This will also have to take account of concurrent initiatives, such as the proposed Global Vaccine-Development Fund and AMR efforts. Yet while the $1 billion figure might be indicative, the need for significantly greater spending is definitive. Ebola revealed deficiencies in many aspects of our product armory, including diagnostics, protective equipment, therapeutics, and vaccines- and we have known about Ebola for nearly 40 years.\n\nWe anticipate that the $1 billion will comprise a mixture of pooled funding, from which contributors will delegate deployment to the PPDC, and coordinated funding, where contributors retain control over funds deployment but collaborate through the PPDC to achieve better coordination. The Commission envisions that the $1 billion for R&D could be drawn from five potential sources: 1. direct contributions from national governments, foundations, and the private sector; 2. from R&D budgets devoted to national security; 3. from existing public, philanthropic, and university R&D budgets in the health arena; 4. by catalyzing private-sector R&D; and 5. by generating new sources of private finance from outside the health care sector, such as the life insurance, travel, and tourism and meat and poultry trade sectors. Here, there is scope for exploring innovative financing solutions.\n\nConclusion on Financing\n\nThe Commission believes that there is a powerful argument for committing greater resources to counter the threat of pandemics. For around $4.5 billion per year, we could make the world much safer. At more than $3 billion, by far the biggest component of this incremental spending arises from the imperative to upgrade the public health infrastructure and capabilities of national health systems. We are convinced that greater investment in prevention, identification, and preparedness offers compelling returns. Most of this funding should derive from local domestic resources, both because health security should be a key priority for any government and because this will ensure long-term sustainability. However, lowand lower-middle-income countries, as well as failed and fragile states, will require international support to fill the gaps in required infrastructure and capabilities. The second largest component of the $4.5 billion is the proposed incremental $1 billion for product R&D. To have stronger weapons with which to fight new or reemerging infectious diseases, we need to step up the pace of R&D, and do so in a coordinated manner. Finally, there is the need to reinforce and refocus WHO, so that it can play a more effective leadership role, and to ensure that WHO and the World Bank are ready and able to deploy funds quickly when a crisis occurs.\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY86\n\nREVERSING NEGLECT: THE CHALLENGE\n\nOF ACTION Pandemics represent too big a threat to ignore. Yet the world has largely done so. Taking a hard look at what we have actually achieved in terms of prevention, preparedness, and response, it is hard to escape the conclusion that we have neglected this aspect of global security. The time has come to reverse this. Doing so will require determined leadership, funding, and collaboration. We must seize this opportunity to make the world safer.\n\nYet we know that political commitment to devoting resources to such a task will wane as memories of the last infectious disease crisis fade. This is why we believe global leaders should commit now to commissioning an independent report in 2017, and again 3 years later. This is how we can be held accountable for what we deliver and what we let slip.\n\nThe actions we recommend are achievable. The funding we envision remains a fraction of what is spent on other risks. A much stronger, more resilient global framework to combat the threat of infectious disease is within our reach. The challenge is whether we have the leadership to make it happen.\n\nKucharski, A. J., A. Camacho, S. Flasche, R. Glover, W. J. Edmunds, and S. Funk. 2015.

Pandemics are rare events, and we have relatively few data points to inform predictive models, with only three observed influenza pandemics in the 20th century.\n\nWe can, however, use the limited data we have to help us get a sense of the scale of likely losses. We can start, for example, by estimating how many pandemics we might see this century. We know that the 20th century saw three pandemics, so it might be reasonable to assume that there is around a 3 percent chance that a pandemic might occur in any given year. This means that, while on average we might get three pandemics each century, because of random variation, some centuries might get more and some might get fewer. We can use simulation models to give us a feel for how much the number of pandemics each century might vary due to random chance, and doing this gives us the distribution shown in Figure C-1.1\n\nOne important feature of this chart is that, although we would expect to see three or fewer events the majority\n\nWe use simulation to estimate the distribution of expected pandemic events per century by running 10,000 simulations of random draws from a binomial distribution, where the number of events, X, is distributed X~Bin(100,(3/100)). In doing this we are simulating the losses that might occur in 10,000 centuries and aggregating the results to show us how likely it is that we see different numbers of events per century, on average. Our principal modeling assumptions are that the probability of an event occurring in any year is fixed at 3 percent (derived from the observation of three influenza pandemics in the 20th century) and that the probability of an event occurring in any year is independent of whether events occurred in other years that century. 1 of the time, there is a chance of the world experiencing more. Indeed, the 19th century saw five pandemics of cholera alone, which, although not directly comparable to the situation today, gives us a sense that the order of magnitude predicted by our model is reasonable.\n\nOur model probably represents a conservative estimate of the risk of pandemic events; that is to say, there are reasons to believe the true risk could be higher. Our model uses data from the 20th century; however, a key conclusion of this report is that the risk of pandemic events is higher than it has been before and without further action is likely to continue to rise (see Box C-1).\n\nTo estimate the scale of economic losses associated with future pandemics, we can apply the same strategy of using what we know about previous pandemics to model the impact of future pandemics. Previous work has estimated the economic loss that occurred as a result of each of the 20th-century pandemics as 0.7-4.8 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP) (McKibben and Sidorenko, 2006). We can use these estimates to develop models of how much damage might be done to the global economy during future pandemics. Again, we use simulation models that take into account the uncertainty associated with the number of pandemics that might happen, as well as uncertainty associated with the damage done by pandemics when they strike. Using the same approach we used for modeling the number of events per century, we model the economic losses of these events throughout a century and use these estimates to get a distribution of expected annual losses2 (see Figure C-2).\n\nThis model uses simulation to estimate the distribution of expected 2\n\nAppendix C Modeling the Economic Threat of Pandemics\n\nAnas El Turabi and Philip Saynisch Harvard University\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY110\n\nAPPENDIX C 111\n\nWe can see that our model estimates an average loss to the global economy of more than $60 billion per year- or more than $6 trillion per century. Again, an important feature of the distribution of expected economic losses is that they exhibit a long right tail; that is to say, there is a nontrivial chance of seeing much more extreme losses. For example, the model predicts a 10 percent chance that average losses this century will be more than $120 billion per year. Indeed, it is because our model accommodates for the possibility of these rarer but more extreme outcomes that our estimate of average losses is higher than the $30 billion calculated by the World Bank.\n\nNo model can perfectly predict the economic losses that will arise from future pandemics, and all models have their limitations. Our model is dependent on the validity and accuracy of our input data and the assumptions we make about how representative these data are of the underlying pandemic phenomena (frequency of oc- economic losses due to pandemic events per century, which we then report in annualized form. It achieves this by first simulating for each year in a century whether a pandemic occurs (X) by drawing randomly from a Bernoulli distribution with a probability of 3 percent (X~Bern(0.03)). If an event occurs, the economic losses for that event are randomly drawn from a normal distribution with mean and standard deviation derived from the global GDP losses calculated by McKibben and Sidorenko for 20th century influenza pandemics (0.7 percent, 3.1 percent, and 4.8 percent) applied to a global GDP figure of $74 trillion U.S. dollars (the International Monetary Fund estimate for global GDP for 2015). These draws are repeated for each year in a century to give a total loss for that simulated century. The results of 10,000 such simulations are then aggregated to give the distribution of expected losses per century, and these results are then divided by 100 to give the annualized expected losses presented above. currence and impact).3 Although our input data are not perfect (in that they relate to events stretching back to 1918 that may be of less relevance today), they are the same figures that a number of authorities, including the World Bank, have used when estimating the economic impact of pandemic events ( Jonas, 2014). Additionally, using different input figures derived from those used by commercial insurers, as well as using different models to account for the uncertainty of these estimates, has little effect on the scale of our estimates.4 Put more plainly, the story remains the same, even when we use alternative input data and different statistical models.\n\nA number of limitations mean that our model probably underestimates the economic threat of pandemic disease events. First, our model only estimates the risk associated with pandemics, and takes no account of the burden of pre-pandemic events such as outbreaks and epidemics, which are substantial. Second, our model assumes the risk of pandemic events this century will be broadly the same as they were in the 20th century; in reality, however, the risk of pandemic events is probably\n\nThis includes our parametric assumptions about the underlying distributions from which the historical data are realized. 4 We explored alternative parameterizations of the distributions of economic losses (uniform and beta) using alternative sources for economic loss inputs ( Jonung and Roeger, 2006) and found that our expected annualized losses remained in the range of $60-$65 billion U.S. dollars with a similar right-tailed distribution as found in our main analysis. Using models which explored expected costs over shorter time horizons than 100 years led to no change in the average expected loss but greater uncertainty of expected losses, producing heavier-tailed distributions. 3\n\nTHE NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF GLOBAL SECURITY112 greater now and rising (see Box C-1). Finally, our model only predicts the economic losses associated with the first year after a pandemic event, while previous research suggests that the economic impact of pandemics probably extends 3 to 4 years (McKibben and Sidorenko, 2006). Our estimates might thus be considered conservative.\n\nSo, given the range of estimates for the economic losses as a result of pandemic events, which number should we have in mind when considering the risk posed to the global economy? In one sense it does not matter. All of the proposed figures, from $30 billion to more than $120 billion, represent losses large enough to warrant concerted action. And, with only one-third of countries declaring that they have met the standards for infectious disease control mandated by the International Health Regulations (WHO, 2015), it is clear that we have failed to invest properly to address these risks. On the other hand, there is good reason to believe that our model represents a conservative estimate of the losses that will occur, so we may be justified in focusing on the higher numbers. The argument for this approach is strengthened when we consider the asymmetric consequences of over- versus under-investment in pandemic prevention and response and the tendency of societies to be risk averse. Governments, because they are responsible for the protection of citizens' welfare, are especially likely to be risk averse to outcomes with potential to cause catastrophic damage to the health and prosperity of their nations. For these reasons, it may be reasonable to consider our estimate of expected annual losses from the global economy of $60 billion per year a \"low\" realistic estimate.\n\nJonas, O., 2014.
