Major exmples originating as diseases of animal origin include with bats s the primary host, SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in he early 20 0 0s [1], MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome [2] ) nd Ebola in the early to mid-2010s [3], and the Zika virus in the id-20 0 0s and the mid-2010s with mosquitoes as vectors [4] . Now he start of the 2020s has been marked by a new viral respiratory andemic out of China: Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) disase, a respiratory illness not previously reported in humans [5] .\n\nThe respiratory coronavirus (CoV) causing SARS originated in hina and ran from November 2001 to July 2003, with civet cats iving in bat caves not identified as an intermediate host until 2017 1] . The reported international incidence of SARS was 8422 cases ith a mortality rate of 11%, higher in patients aged 65 years or lder [1] . Since 2004, no known cases of SARS have been reported.\n\nThe coronavirus causing MERS (Middle East Respiratory Synrome) was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012, with camels as n intermediate host [2] . Mass migration of pilgrims to and from ecca contributed to the spread of the infection. There have been t least 2260 reported cases of confirmed MERS-CoV infection and t least 803 related deaths [2] Most patients with clinical features f MERS-CoV infection have had chronic co-morbidities [2] . Unlike ARS, MERS remains a serious infectious disease, with cases in at east 27 countries - i.e., it has progressed from an epidemic to an ndemic disease [2] .\n\nThe outbreak of the Ebola hemorrhagic fever epidemic in West frica lasted over 2 years from 2014 to 2016, ending with over 8,600 cases and 11,325 deaths [3] . Primates and the dik-dik ante- ope were the intermediate hosts, entering the human food chain s bush meat. Ebola is highly contagious and needs effective isolaion of patients, barrier protection for medical staff and access to ophisticated medical facilities. A new outbreak in 2018 of Ebola in he Democratic Republic of Congo is continuing, its control much ore difficult as cases are occurring in a war zone [6] .\n\nThe Zika RNA flavivirus (ZIKV) is a member of the same arovirus family as dengue (DENV), West Nile, yellow fever, and apanese encephalitis viruses and is transmitted by the mosquito 4] . The Zika virus story illustrates the potential for evolving risks rom other viral pathogens. Initial strains of the virus affecting on-human primates were detected in Uganda in 1947 and the rst human case was reported in 1962. The Zika virus then evolved y 1966 as a strain that had spread to Asia and was transmissible y human-adapted Aedes mosquitoes, with however few human ttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.hlpt.2020.02.001 211-8837/© 2020 Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rig ases recognized until 2007 [4] . The epidemiology of the virus hen changed, with outbreaks of infection in the Pacific in 2007 nd in 2013-2014, followed by epidemic spread in 2015-2016 n the Americas, the Caribbean and Africa. Clinical effects of he Zika virus can be insidious [4] . Acute infections may have inimal symptoms however the Zika virus has been implicated in ausing auto-immune disease, including the serious neurological isorder Guillain-Barré Syndrome, and in pregnancy Zika can ause the serious birth defect microcephaly [4] . Up to January 018, over 3700 cases of ZIKV infection-associated congenital irth defects had been reported in the Americas [4] . The Zika pidemic shows the ability of a virus to evolve, to spread through uman travel and vector mobility, and be efficiently transmitted ithin new regions among susceptible populations that have ot been previously exposed [4] . No outbreaks of Zika infection re currently flagged by the US Centers for Disease Control and revention [7] .\n\nWhat do we know about the new 2019-nCoV coronavirus synrome [5] ? At the end of December 2019, the Chinese authoriies reported a new respiratory flu-like syndrome originating in uhan, a city in Central China with around 11 million inhabitants. omplications in the initial 41 patients reported from Wuhan up o 2nd January 2020 included acute respiratory distress syndrome, cute cardiac injury and secondary infection [5] . A third of these atients were admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU); these paients had higher levels of inflammatory cytokines than those not dmitted to ICU [5] . Following a serious delay by Chinese authorties in reporting and action in the first two weeks of the month, y the 28th January there had been over 4500 cases reported f Wuhan 2019-nCoV disease and 100 deaths [8] . By then, cases f 2019-nCoV infection had been reported in a further 15 counries, including elsewhere in Southeast Asia, Australia, Europe and orth America Cases of person-to-person transmission have been eported, including in Germany, in a UK citizen visiting Singapore, ossible materno-foetal transmission, and in 61 of 3700 passengers n a cruise ship quarantined off Yokohama, Japan. The initial dou- ling interval appears around 5 days, with on 7th February the Euopean Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reporting n increase to 31,503 laboratory-confirmed cases (31,217 in China) nd 638 deaths, all but one in China. Up to the time of this editoial there have now been reports of 286 cases in 25 further counries and territories [9] . Mortality is reportedly highest in frail paients, however there have already been reports of 2019-nCoV atributed deaths in health professionals in China [5], including Dr Li hts reserved. i t o c t a t W\n\nA o a i H\n\nR\n\n[\n\nWenliang, the 34 year old Chinese ophthalmologist who was the first to alert his medical colleagues to the outbreak of this new coronavirus syndrome [10] .\n\nAppropriate health policy requires bold, timely and effective actions. These would be expected to include preparedness of equipment, staff and facilities based on learning from previous epidemics, clear public health information, relevant containment, surveillance, and reporting, and international cooperation among governments, health authorities, travel organisations and border control forces. This includes the need for the WHO and the international community to provide financial and health professional resources to middle and low income countries for detecting, treating and controlling spread of the disease. There were two particular initial and ongoing concerns for public health authorities about Wuhan 2019-nCoV. Firstly, the epidemic began at a time of major international migration of more than one billion Chinese to mark celebrations of the Lunar New Year. Secondly, affected individuals are infective before symptoms appear [5] .\n\nDiagnostic tests for 2019-nCoV are already available internationally. As a marker of global forward planning, the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium has prepared standard forms and these were used to record data in the Lancet report on initially affected patients [5] . The ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe are coordinating the rapid reporting of data [9] . Public health measures in place in China since late January include bans on travel from the city of Wuhan, with overall 15 cities - a population of 57 million - under full or partial travel lockdown [11], major sporting events cancelled and gatherings banned, including for weddings and birthdays, and limits on how many family members can leave home each day. On 28th January 2020, Hong Kong announced closure of many border crossings with mainland China [8] . USA, Japan, Russia and Australia and many other countries have now closed their borders to arrivals from China. Checks are now in place at many international airports for symptoms and fever in travelers from China, with international 14 day quarantine for travellers at risk. With remarkable speed, new 10 0 0 bed containment hospital for suspected coronavirus cases was built and opened in Wuhan on 3rd February and a further new 1500 bed hospital is under construction.\n\nWhether these and other measures are sufficient responses to the Wuhan coronavirus will soon be apparent. In particular, we have yet to see whether international lessons on pandemic preparedness have been learned from the experience of earlier coronavirus and other viral epidemics. Containment and good medical care, including access to high dependency and intensive care support, are the only measures currently available against Wuhan 2019-nCoV. There are already concerns about shortages of high dependency medical beds, medical equipment and the barrier clothing needed to treat patients safely and effectively. Controlling the animal hosts is not yet an option: animal origins for the Wuhan coronavirus are yet to be established and it took 15 years to do so for the SARS CoV [1] . It is worth noting that 18 and 6 years respectively since their reported emergence, no specific drug treatment or vaccines are yet available for the SARS and MERS coronaviruses. A further important concern is the major downturn n the Chinese and global economy resulting from measures being aken in China and around the world to try to contain the spread f Wuhan 2019-nCoV.\n\nFuture issues of the journal will include expert reports and ommentaries from health policy and health technology perspecives on evolution of the 2019-nCoV pandemic. The journal would lso welcome submissions of commentaries and other papers on he implications for health policy and health technology of the uhan 2019-nCoV and other epidemics. uthor Statements The author has no conflict of interest to declare.
