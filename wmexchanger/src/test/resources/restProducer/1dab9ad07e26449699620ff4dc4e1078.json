Infectious disease emergencies prompting U.S. and international response efforts have  involved previously unknown pathogens, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus  and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, as well as known pathogens causing  outbreaks of unprecedented magnitude, such as Zika virus and Ebola virus. These and many  other emerging or re‐emerging infectious diseases of humans are zoonotic-they originate, and  may persist, in non‐human animal species. Other pathogens affecting only animals or plants,  such as foot‐and‐mouth disease and sudden oak death, respectively, may threaten food  security, trade, and ecosystems. A convergence of factors including globalized travel and trade,  climate change, urbanization, and agricultural practices contributes to infectious disease  outbreaks of humans, animals, and plants. In recent years, a new, interdisciplinary science has  drawn on advances in pathogen biology, genomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning to  develop computer‐based models to predict infectious disease outbreaks, or project their course.  These computational tools increasingly support a range of decisions in outbreak preparedness  and response, and were used extensively in recent outbreaks. U.S. public health preparedness  strategies recognize the potential of these tools to improve outbreak preparedness and  response, and many Federal agencies fund research and development programs in outbreak  prediction and modeling.  \n\nDrawing on this broad interagency experience, the Pandemic Prediction and Forecasting Science  and Technology Working Group (PPFST WG), of the National Science and Technology Council, in  this report identifies challenges in outbreak prediction and modeling and offers  recommendations for Federal actions to advance the development and effective application of  outbreak prediction capabilities. The three major challenge areas, and recommendations to  address the challenges (to be implemented within existing authorities and resources), are:  \n\nChallenge #1: Data‐ and information‐sharing.   Recommendation 1: Identify key questions likely to arise during outbreak response decision‐ making to help define and prioritize data collection and modeling goals.   Recommendation 2: Adopt a common plan for identifying the minimal essential, publicly‐ releasable data to support outbreak decision‐making and for rapidly processing, updating,  and sharing these data publicly in a form readily usable for analysis by computational tools.  \n\n Recommendation 3: Collaborate with professional organizations, state and local public  health offices, and other stakeholders to develop standards for collecting and sharing the  types of data needed for modeling and analysis during outbreaks.  \n\n Recommendation 4: Ensure that data obtained with Federal funds that may address key  questions during outbreak response decision‐making is shared rapidly with other Federal  stakeholders and in a form readily usable for analysis with computational tools (and with  meta‐data that describes potential restrictions). \n\n Recommendation 5: Ensure that analytical products (e.g., scientific manuscripts) generated  with Federal funds that may address key questions during outbreak response decision‐\n\n2  making, or inform remediation efforts following such an emergency, and that are  appropriate for public release, are shared rapidly with the public free of charge. \n\n Recommendation 6: Develop science and technology solutions to the privacy, security, and  related challenges that impede data access, such as de‐identification algorithms and  synthetic datasets. \n\nChallenge #2: Outbreak model development and decision support.   Recommendation 7: Enable Federal efforts to systematically identify outbreak modeling  studies as they become available; conduct controlled comparisons of models if source code  is accessible; assess the quality of models and modeling studies; and maintain current  estimates of key epidemiological and pathogen parameters through synthesis of modeling  results. \n\n Recommendation 8: Strengthen communication and coordination between modeling  groups and Federal offices requiring outbreak decision support. \n\n Recommendation 9: Strengthen support for development of standards or best practices to  assess outbreak model attributes and performance. \n\n Recommendation 10: Strengthen support for controlled comparisons of outbreak modeling  approaches to identify preferred approaches for possible real‐world scenarios. \n\n Recommendation 11: Strengthen support for development of decision‐support methods  and tools to facilitate synthesis and adjudication of results across multiple models. \n\n Recommendation 12: Establish criteria for public release of outbreak model code developed  with Federal funds, and ensure that code that is appropriate for public release is shared  publicly, free of charge, no later than the time that the scientific paper describing the model  is published.  \n\n Recommendation 13: Establish active, population‐based surveillance testbeds for rigorous  development, comparison, and validation of infectious disease models (first consideration  should be given to building modeling components into existing epidemiological surveillance  or research efforts).  \n\nChallenge #3: Science of disease emergence.   Recommendation 14: Develop a \"One Health\" national strategy for predictive modeling of  potential infectious disease threats globally, encompassing human, animal, plant, and  environmental health priorities, science, and communities.\n\nToward Epidemic Prediction: Federal Efforts and Opportunities in Outbreak Modeling \n\n3 \n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Threat of Emerging Infectious Disease Outbreaks Infectious disease outbreaks have surprised humanity throughout history. New diseases appear  without warning, even today. Outbreaks of familiar diseases regularly occur where and when  they are not expected.  \n\nDuring 2015‐2016, an outbreak caused by the Zika virus has swept across much of the Western  Hemisphere, its transmission driven primarily by the widely‐distributed Aedes aegypti  mosquito. Zika virus infection during pregnancy has resulted in thousands of devastating birth  defects, and the fear of many more to come. In August 2016, the United States Government  declared a public health emergency in Puerto Rico, which has experienced more than 32,000  Zika cases as of December 2016, including more than 2,000 pregnant women. Transmission is  occurring also in the U.S. Virgin Islands, and limited local transmission occurred in Florida and  Texas. Researchers discovered the Zika virus almost 70 years ago in Africa, but it received little  attention before the current outbreak. Until recently, Zika was an obscure pathogen that caused  mild disease in endemic settings or in occasional outbreaks that died out.  \n\nThe Zika outbreak is just the latest public health emergency caused by an infectious disease.  West Africa will long be recovering from the Ebola outbreak of 2014‐2016, which killed  approximately 11,000 people in the region and reached the United States and Europe. Although  Ebola virus has also been known for decades, prior outbreaks had never been known to affect  more than 500 people. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS‐CoV), first  identified in 2012, spread to dozens of countries worldwide, infected approximately 1,800  people, and caused death in one‐third of those infected. A novel and virulent influenza strain  could arise at any time and cause a catastrophic pandemic. The most severe, in 1918, caused an  estimated 50‐100 million deaths; a severe influenza pandemic today could possibly kill at least  as many (despite medical and public health advances) (Osterholm, 2005) and bring about a  global recession costing more than $3 trillion (World Bank, 2008). \n\nThe number, per year, of human infectious disease outbreaks and of diseases causing outbreaks  has increased since 1980, according to one study (Smith et al., 2014). These recent outbreaks  involve novel emerging diseases like MERS and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), as  well as known diseases that are re‐emerging-appearing in new areas, developing resistance to  treatments, or otherwise behaving in unfamiliar ways.  \n\nContributing to the emergence (or re‐emergence) of infectious disease of humans is a  convergence of factors, including ecosystem alteration, urbanization, agricultural intensification,  climate change, and globalized travel and trade (Morse, 1995; Smolinski et al., 2003). Especially  important are factors that promote connections across humans, animals, and the environment  (or ecosystem), enabling microbial spillover from natural reservoirs to humans. Zika, Ebola,  MERS‐CoV, and pandemic influenza viruses are human pathogens that originate in animals  (\"zoonotic\" pathogens), as are most emerging and re‐emerging infectious diseases of humans  (Woolhouse and Gowtage‐Sequeria, 2005; Appendix 1). Since 2003, the United States has used  Emergency Supplemental appropriations 6 times to support Federal response to zoonotic \n\n4  viruses: for SARS‐CoV (2003); avian or pandemic influenza (2005, 2006, and 2009), Ebola (2015),  and Zika (2016).  \n\nSome of the factors contributing to human disease outbreaks also help drive infectious disease  outbreaks of plants and animals, which are a threat to health, food security, economies, and  ecosystems. For example, in 2014‐2015, viral reassortment events combining North American  and Eurasian avian influenza strains led to the emergence of novel strains that spilled over into  commercial and backyard poultry operations across the United States. It was the largest animal  health disaster in U.S. history, with removal and disposal of nearly 50 million birds.  Approximately $879 million was spent on response activities and preparing for reemergence of  the disease (Johnson et al., 2016).  \n\nPublic health response to emerging infectious disease threats has often been largely reactive-a  response is mounted after an outbreak is recognized. The United States need not, and should  not, accept this status quo. Recent advances in science and technology (S&T) provide  opportunities to mitigate large‐scale outbreaks by predicting more accurately when and where  outbreaks are likely to occur, and how they will progress. These S&T advances will not provide  certainty, and will be constrained by limitations in scientific knowledge and epidemiological  data, especially for novel diseases. But, if translated effectively into real‐world applications, they  can support better decisions about how, when, and where to apply public health resources to  limit disease impact.   \n\nThis report describes how the United States can harness S&T to advance the development and  implementation of models to predict and mitigate the impacts of infectious disease outbreaks.  The report provides an overview of the emerging field of outbreak modeling, surveys current  Federal initiatives, describes challenges, and identifies possible Federal directions to surmount  the challenges. \n\nInfectious Disease Outbreak Modeling\n\nPublic health scientists rely increasingly on computational tools to understand epidemiological  patterns and guide prevention and control measures (Heesterbeek et al., 2015). A new,  interdisciplinary science is forming around the development of these approaches, spurred by  scientific advances across a range of areas (including pathogen biology, genomics,  bioinformatics, ecology, and machine learning), as well as near‐real‐time availability of relevant  data during outbreaks (including traditional epidemiological data as well as newer data types  such as pathogen genetic sequences, human mobility patterns, and social media data). \n\nOne especially promising area of this new field of computational biosciences is epidemiological  predictive modeling-computer‐based mathematical approaches to project the course of an  outbreak that is underway, or to anticipate disease emergence or outbreaks (Box 1).  \n\n5 \n\nBox 1. Overview of approaches to outbreak modeling.  These models use diverse methods and data sources. One way of classifying them (simplistic though  often helpful) is to view them as phenomenological or as mechanistic models. Phenomenological  models describe or predict outbreak dynamics with no or little use of explicit assumptions about  disease transmission. Examples include extrapolation of an epidemic curve using simple mathematical  equations, and complex machine learning methods. Mechanistic approaches, in contrast, model the  process of disease transmission. These also range from simple to quite complex, with dozens of  parameters relating the state of the model at a given time to its future state, which must be estimated  from the data or imputed. Traditional mechanistic models group classes of individuals together;  computational advances now enable individual‐based models for large populations, which model  individual‐level behavior and interactions.  \n\nMany types of descriptive and predictive models were used during recent, large‐scale  outbreaks. They addressed one or more of the following five uncertainties, which are the  typical applications of modeling for outbreaks:  \n\n1. Outbreak growth rate and future course. A key parameter describing outbreak dynamics  is the reproduction number, or the number of entities (individuals or sub‐populations,  such as herds or flocks), on average, infected by each infected entity. Early‐outbreak  estimates of the reproduction number provide an initial assessment of how rapidly the  outbreak is growing; repeated over time, estimation of the reproduction number can  help gauge the effectiveness of the response. A related modeling application is near‐ term forecasting of important public health quantities, such as the number of infections,  clinical cases, or deaths.   2. Geographic spread. Datasets on travel and trade allow modelers to assess pathogen  importation risk (e.g., for airports, farms, or ecosystems), identify areas at high risk for  importation, and evaluate the utility of screening, or travel or trade restrictions. Such  models may be coupled with disease transmission models to assess the chance that  pathogen importation could spark a local outbreak. Other types of mobility data, such as  anonymized mobile phone records, also have facilitated important insights into the role  of population flows in disease outbreaks. More granular, empirical insights into disease  transmission networks are possible with genomic pathogen surveillance during  outbreaks; when coupled with standard epidemiological data, it can identify  transmission links across spatially‐distributed areas.      3. Possible interventions and clinical trials. A major contribution of outbreak modeling is  assessment and comparison of possible control measures, such as limiting large  gatherings, tracing contacts of patients to identify infections early, distributing drugs or  vaccines, and culling animals on infected farms. Modeling allows such interventions to  be evaluated in simulated environments before resources are devoted to implementing  them. Models also allow researchers to determine the feasibility of launching large‐scale  field trials to evaluate new vaccines and therapeutics while the outbreak is underway.    4. Pathogen evolution and genetic determinants of function. As genomic data becomes  available on pathogens circulating during an outbreak, models can establish how the  outbreak strain is related to any strains that had previously been catalogued. These  models can help in determining when the outbreak began, provide clues to important  pathogen characteristics, and inform public health decisions that reduce the impact of \n\n6  the outbreak. Models can use genomic surveillance data to detect evolutionary changes  during the outbreak that could indicate further adaptation to new host species (animal  or human) or vectors, which could portend more extensive transmission.  \n\n5. Pathogen origin and drivers of emergence. Few models attempt to predict the time and  place of an outbreak beforehand, but retrospective studies of outbreak precursors have  identified possible precipitating factors, and a broad class of models attempts to identify  settings that could be conducive to disease emergence or spread (Box 2). Operationally  useful models have been developed for some climate‐sensitive diseases, such as those  transmitted by arthropod vectors whose abundance and behavior are tightly linked with  temperature, precipitation, vegetation patterns, and other aspects of weather or the  environment. For zoonotic diseases, studies in areas of disease emergence that identify  wildlife or domestic animal species, the microbes they carry, and animal or human  behaviors that could promote spillover have been especially revealing.  \n\nBox 2. Predicting disease risk: Example of plant pest phenology and climate suitability.  These models are based on the biology of the specific pest and match the pest biology with climate  and host characteristics to support plant pest detection activities. U.S. applications include models for  various pests, such as Dendrolimus pini (pine tree lappet moth), Epiphyas postvittana (light brown  apple moth), Helicoverpa armigera (Old world bollworm), Monachamus alternatus (Japanese pine  sawyer beetle), Platypus quercivorus (oak ambrosia beetle), Thaumatotibia leucotreta (false codling  moth). These pests can attack numerous host species, some (such as the old world bollworm) with  hundreds of plant host species, including row crops (such as wheat, corn and cotton), vegetables (like  peppers and tomatoes), and fruit crops (strawberries and stone fruits).  \n\nModelers drew on diverse data sources to generate insights into these uncertainties during the  recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the current Zika outbreak in the Americas, and non‐ human disease outbreaks in the United States, such as highly pathogenic avian influenza, white‐ nose syndrome in bats, and sudden oak death. Extensive modeling occurred during some of  these emergencies (Box 3).  \n\nBox 3. Modeling to support recent outbreak responses.  Ebola: When the West Africa Ebola outbreak gained international attention in March 2014, initial  reports warned that it was already spiraling out of control, but data collection and reporting challenges  hampered assessment of the situation. Key knowledge gaps included the importance of various  transmission settings and the virulence of the outbreak virus strain. Preliminary models incorporated  the limited available data to estimate the growth rate of the epidemic and predict its course in the  absence of public health intervention. These early forecasts were cited widely in calls for a major  international response. Analyses of viral genomic data and epidemiological data suggested that the  outbreak had begun with the introduction of a new Ebola virus strain in late 2013, and showed that  human travel was propagating the outbreak across urban centers and national borders. As the outbreak  continued, detailed mechanistic models tested various possible interventions, and suggested that  control could most quickly be achieved with a combination of hospital‐ and community‐based  measures, such as safe burial practices and prohibition of eating and serving bushmeat. Models also  were used to support planning of anticipated field trials of candidate vaccines against Ebola.    \n\nZika: The Zika outbreak in the Americas also spurred a vigorous response by the modeling community,  like the 2014‐2016 Ebola outbreak did. As with Ebola, models were used to predict disease burden and \n\n7  international spread and define the genetic lineage of the outbreak virus strain, and contended with  knowledge limitations similar to those encountered in the Ebola response. Models also were used to  address additional uncertainties around the Zika epidemic. For example, they assessed the risk of  international spread associated with the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; the risk of  local transmission by competent mosquito vectors if infected travelers introduce the virus into new  areas; the resources needed to screen donated blood for Zika virus; and the risk of birth defects in  infants born to women infected during pregnancy.    \n\nHighly Pathogenic Avian Influenza: In support of the response to the 2014‐2015 outbreak of highly  pathogenic avian influenza in the United States, models were developed to simulate disease  introduction and spread within U.S. avian migratory flyways. These models were used to evaluate  alternative control strategies for their impact on outbreak severity, duration, and economic  consequences, including trade losses. This enabled improvements in surveillance design, planning for  business continuity, evaluation of vaccination strategies, resource planning for diagnostic testing, and  stockpiling of personal protective equipment and antiviral drugs.  Phylogenetic models were used to  better understand disease spread and inform efforts to improve biosecurity on farms.  \n\nFederal Efforts in Outbreak Modeling\n\nThe White House and Federal agencies have recognized the promise of modeling to improve  epidemic preparedness and response. The policy foundation for Federal outbreak modeling  includes the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan (2006), which  identified models as \"powerful tools that can be used to inform policy decisions by highlighting  the impact of various interventions on the spread of disease\"; National Strategy for  Biosurveillance (2012), which included forecasting as a core function of biosurveillance; and  National Biosurveillance Science and Technology Roadmap (2013), which noted  that \"New  modeling and ecological forecasting approaches have the potential to enhance the  effectiveness of current strategies for predicting the likelihood of disease outbreaks and  determining the likely impacts when a threat is detected.\"  \n\nTo advance national capabilities for outbreak modeling, the National Science and Technology  Council in 2014 chartered an interagency group, the Pandemic Prediction and Forecasting  Science and Technology Working Group (PPFST WG). The PPFST WG provides Federal agencies  a forum to coordinate priorities and activities in outbreak modeling. Many of its participating  agencies support programs in the area, ranging from foundational research into the ecological  and biological factors driving disease emergence to operational modeling that supports  decisions during outbreaks (Table 1). \n\nTable 1.

National Institutes of Health: Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study  (collaboration of research and informatics groups to develop  computational models of the interactions between infectious agents and  their hosts, disease spread, prediction systems and response strategies),  Research and Policy in Infectious Disease Dynamics (funding by  Department of Homeland Security; workshops, working groups,  fellowships to advance mathematical modeling of infectious diseases).  \n\nDepartment of Homeland  Security  S&T Directorate: Research and Policy for Infectious Disease Dynamics  (workshops, working groups, fellowships to advance mathematical  modeling of infectious diseases). \n\nDepartment of the  Interior \n\nU.S. Geological Survey: Intramural expertise across eight science centers  in modeling of infectious diseases in aquatic and terrestrial wildlife, with  an emphasis on understanding impacts on natural resources; includes  the National Wildlife Health Center (bureau lead for terrestrial wildlife  disease surveillance, which maintains high‐biocontainment laboratories,  is a World Organisation for Animal Health collaborating center, and \n\n9  conducts research and transmission modeling for diseases in wildlife,  including avian influenza, plague, and other zoonoses).     \n\nEnvironmental Protection  Agency  Office of Research and Development: Risk modeling of infectious  diseases (vector‐borne and biothreat agent) using environmental and  socio‐economic predictors.  \n\nIntelligence Advanced  Research Projects Activity  Mercury (forecasting disease outbreaks using large volumes of data  streams and ensemble techniques). \n\nNational Aeronautics and  Space Administration  Earth Science/Public Health Application Area: Application of earth  observations to public health, particularly for infectious diseases and  other priority areas. \n\nNational Science  Foundation \n\nDirectorate for Biological Sciences: Ecology and Evolution of Infectious  Diseases (research on the ecological, evolutionary, and socio‐ecological  principles and processes that influence transmission dynamics of  infectious diseases). \n\nU.S. Agency for  International  Development \n\nEmerging Pandemic Threats (regional, national, and local One Health  capacity‐building, including detection and discovery of zoonotic diseases  at the wildlife‐human interface). \n\nSeveral of these agencies re‐direct or focus efforts when new infectious disease threats arise,  such as during the current Zika epidemic (Box 4). \n\nBox 4. Selected examples of the Federal outbreak modeling response to Zika.  \n\nOperational modeling and data‐ and information‐sharing. Biomedical Advanced Research and  Development Authority performed real‐time epidemic analysis to estimate demand for diagnostics and  treatment resources, and convened the Modeling Coordination Group with Federal and non‐Federal  partners regularly to promote sharing of data and modeling results. Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention estimated the risk for severe outcomes, such as microcephaly, and established a public  website for sharing of machine‐readable epidemiological data. \n\nModeling‐related research & development. National Institutes of Health supported studies that  modeled possible Zika control strategies; co‐risk and interactions of Zika and other arthropod‐borne  viruses; genetic determinants of Zika emergence and fitness; competence of Aedes aegypti and Aedes  albopictus to transmit Zika; and possible mosquito vector insecticide resistance, among other research.  National Science Foundation funded rapid‐response grants to develop predictive models and discover  principles governing transmission dynamics for Zika. U.S. Geological Survey provided technical  assistance for surveillance of the non‐native Aedes vectors on Department of the Interior lands;  supported studies to investigate the role of wildlife in Zika dynamics in the Americas; and developed  flavivirus transmission risk models using climate, remote sensing and other geospatial data. \n\n10 \n\nChallenges and Recommendations Agencies across the Federal government are devoting research and development (R&D) funds  to outbreak modeling, reflecting the broad importance of these capabilities across diverse  missions. Potential synergies abound across this Federal landscape, and between Federal and  non‐Federal partners. At the same time, the vigorous application of modeling to recent  outbreaks, within and beyond the Federal government, demonstrates a hope across varied  scientific and public health communities that these models can help mitigate the impact of  outbreaks. The field is poised to transform public health preparedness and response. But it  faces challenges in achieving the vision of epidemic prediction. The following sections describe  the three highest‐priority challenges, and recommends Federal steps to address them. \n\nData‐ and information‐sharing. Obtaining timely and accurate data and information during  outbreaks has long been a major challenge to effective response. Today, though, the demand  for timely and accurate data and information during outbreaks appears greater than ever.  Outbreaks can quickly spiral out of control in a highly interconnected world; decision‐makers  need high‐quality data and information, in near‐real‐time, to keep pace. This need is especially  important at the beginning of a novel disease outbreak, when knowledge about the pathogen  and data on the epidemiological situation is limited.  \n\nThe outbreak modeling community therefore expends considerable effort in obtaining,  cleaning, and updating epidemiological data that are not otherwise available in a readily usable  form. During the Ebola and Zika outbreaks, for example, scientists transformed official Portable  Document Format (pdf) reports from health ministries into machine‐readable datasets, and  shared them online (Rivers, 2015; CDC, 2016a). These datasets were used widely in modeling  applications, and enabled studies by groups that could not have devoted the resources required  to generate those more‐usable data files. \n\nThe need for timely data extends beyond the epidemiological data traditionally collected during  outbreak responses. Innovative models incorporate data on diverse potential predictors, such  as spatio‐temporal data on population locations, movement of hosts of disease agents or  locations of vectors, environmental conditions, human behavior, and public health  interventions. Like officially‐reported outbreak surveillance data, such data may be available  online, but may be scattered around multiple platforms and in different formats.    \n\nAnother, fundamental barrier to outbreak modeling is failure to share data and information.  Various public health and research groups collected epidemiological data as part of the  responses to Zika, Ebola, and other major outbreaks. Some withheld data until they could  publish results, even though the data may have been useful earlier for others to assess  potential response efforts.  \n\nSome who did not share data may not have been aware of how others could use the data to  support the response, or may have felt constrained by privacy considerations or by terms of  agreement with data providers. For example, some Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  operational modeling projects during the Ebola response were delayed because the required  data‐sharing agreements were not in place (Meltzer et al., 2016). Security and intellectual  property concerns also may inhibit data sharing during outbreaks. \n\n11 \n\nA community of interest is building around the need for wider and more rapid sharing of  epidemiological data and information during public health emergencies (Wellcome Trust, 2016;  WHO, 2015a). But the sharing failures of recent outbreaks show that much more needs to be  done. \n\nA PPFST WG survey of WG members and modelers participating in the National Institutes of  Health Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study also provides evidence that incomplete access  to data and information impedes the development and application of outbreak models  (Appendix 2). Among respondents, 56% indicated that lack of access to existing data often or  always delays their work; 33% reported that lack of access often prevents completion of a  modeling project; and 44% had delayed or halted outbreak prediction or response efforts  because existing data could not be obtained. Respondents indicated that if existing data were  more readily available and usable, researchers could create more accurate, better resolved  spatio‐temporal models of infectious diseases to predict phenomena such as Ebola hotspots.  High‐priority data sources included data from electronic health records and pathogen genomic  sequence data. One third cited technical considerations such as data formatting, standards,  procedures, or means of dissemination as a hindrance to their analytical efforts. \n\nTo enable outbreak modeling that provides decision support based on relevant, timely, and  accurate data and information, the Federal government should extend and adapt broader  efforts around data science, open data, and open science (e.g., Executive Order 13642, Making  Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information, 9 May 2013) to  data pertaining to infectious disease outbreaks. Specifically, the WG recommends that the  Federal government, to the extent possible within existing authorities and resources: \n\nRecommendation 1: Identify key questions likely to arise during outbreak response decision‐ making to help define and prioritize data collection and modeling goals. \n\nRecommendation 2: Adopt a common plan for identifying the minimal essential, publicly‐ releasable data to support outbreak decision‐making; and for rapidly processing, updating, and  sharing these data publicly in a form readily usable for analysis by computational tools.  \n\nRecommendation 3: Collaborate with professional organizations, state and local public health  offices, and other stakeholders to develop standards for collecting and sharing the types of data  needed for modeling and analysis during outbreaks.  \n\nRecommendation 4: Ensure that data obtained with Federal funds that may address key  questions during outbreak response decision‐making is shared rapidly with other Federal  stakeholders and in a form readily usable for analysis with computational tools (and with meta‐ data that describes potential restrictions). \n\nRecommendation 5: Ensure that analytical products (e.g., scientific manuscripts) generated with  Federal funds that may address key questions during outbreak response decision‐making, or  inform remediation efforts following such an emergency, and that are appropriate for public  release, are shared rapidly with the public free of charge. \n\nRecommendation 6: Develop S&T solutions to the privacy, security, and related challenges that  impede data access, such as de‐identification algorithms and synthetic datasets. \n\n12 \n\nOutbreak model development and decision support. The extent of modeling during the current  Zika outbreak in the Americas and recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa is noteworthy. More  than 60 Ebola modeling analyses were published during the first 20 months of the outbreak  (Chretien et al., 2015). An interim literature review by the PPFST WG identified 36 Zika  modeling papers (published or as pre‐prints) in the 7 months after the World Health  Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. This abundance of  predictions and insights creates challenges for those making decisions about the response.   \n\nMerely keeping track of new modeling analyses during an outbreak is a demanding task. And, as  best as the PPFST WG can determine, it is a mission that no organization has, within or outside  of the Federal government. There seems to be no enduring, systematic effort anywhere to  identify new modeling studies as they become available; evaluate methodologies; assess the  validity of the approaches; and systematically synthesize results during outbreaks to update  estimates of key epidemiological parameters and predictions, such as the reproduction  number, the effectiveness of interventions, areas that may become affected, and the future  course of the outbreak. Because all models rely on assumptions, efforts such as these to  synthesize results across multiple models that are built on different assumptions help ensure  robust conclusions.  \n\nA retrospective study of forecasts issued during the West Africa Ebola outbreak illustrates the  need for such assessments: predictions of future incidence made at about the same time with  about the same prediction time horizon differed 5‐ to 10‐fold early in the outbreak (Chretien et  al., 2015). As these varied predictions were issued during the outbreak, many public health  analysts and decision‐makers expressed uncertainty about which ones were more credible.  \n\nCross‐model comparisons are more feasible if the code underlying models used during  outbreaks is released, so models can by implemented using standardized data and  assumptions. But sharing of code for outbreak models may be even less common than sharing  of other research products or results. For example, the interim PPFST WG assessment of  modeling for the Zika outbreak found that all studies were made freely available online at the  time of publication, but only one‐fifth included a link to source code with the publication.  \n\nAn example of a promising tool that could help facilitate model comparisons is the  Biosurveillance Analytics Resource Directory (BARD), developed by Los Alamos National  Laboratory and funded by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (Margevicius et al., 2016). The  BARD, however, does not house the models themselves and, to the PPFST WG's knowledge, no  organization is charged with updating it or some similar repository as modeling accelerates  during outbreaks.  \n\nEven with a systematic effort to track modeling results during outbreaks, discerning the more  valid approaches, and thereby identifying the predictions and inferences warranting higher  confidence, would be challenging. The outbreak modeling community has not adopted  standards for assessing and reporting model attributes or performance. For some pathogens,  human data that would be useful in building or validating models are limited or non‐existent.  And, in a dynamic scientific discipline, with new methodologies and data sources frequently  introduced, the best approach in a given epidemiological scenario often is uncertain.  \n\n13 \n\nControlled, multi‐center modeling contests and projects, such as those organized recently by  Federal agencies (Box 5) are generating valuable insights (e.g., simple models often perform as  well as more complex models; model ensembles often perform better than any individual  model), though there have been too few efforts like these to identify the best approaches  across a range of likely scenarios.  \n\nBox 5. Recent federal outbreak prediction competitions.   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): Seasonal Influenza Forecasting. The CDC Influenza  Division has worked with external researchers since 2013 to improve the science and usability of  influenza forecasts by coordinating prediction challenges for seasonal influenza in the United States  (Biggerstaff et al., 2016). CDC's FluSight website (https://predict.phiresearchlab.org/), launched in  2016, displays the weekly forecast of each participating group, allowing comparison of the predictions  to actual disease activity during the current influenza season. This effort is ongoing and is one of the  few operational forecasting systems for an infectious disease in the United States.   \n\nCDC, Department of Defense (DoD), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA): Dengue  Forecasting Project. Several agencies and the PPFST WG coordinated a public contest in 2015 to  predict dengue incidence in Puerto Rico and Peru. CDC and DoD released historical dengue surveillance  data that had not previously been made public for participants to use in model training. NOAA  provided climatological data for consideration in predictive models.  The PPFST WG held a workshop at  the White House with teams that submitted the best‐performing models to identify lessons for  outbreak predictive modeling. \n\nDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA): Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV) Challenge. DARPA  launched the CHIKV Challenge in 2014 as the virus swept through the Americas. Teams from around  the world competed to develop the most accurate predictions of CHIKV cases for all Western  Hemisphere countries and territories. Winners were selected based on overall accuracy and in other  domains, including the tool's applicability and presentation. Los Alamos National Laboratory  performed independent analysis of the entries. \n\nNational Institutes of Health (Fogarty International Center): Ebola Modeling Exercise. Teams from  U.S., U.K., and Canadian universities and several federal agencies predicted the progress of the 2014‐ 2016 West Africa Ebola epidemic under various containment scenarios; results were compared in a  collaborative way to identify general features of more accurate methods and optimal approaches for  different epidemiological settings.    \n\nDepartment of Agriculture: Model Validation Exercise. Teams from the United States, Australia,  Canada, and New Zealand developed model parameter sets and scenarios to compare the predictions  made by three simulation models of foot‐and‐mouth disease in use by these countries, and the  implications of modeling results for decision‐making. This approach of relative validation was identified  as a way to increase end‐user confidence and improve understanding of how model assumptions  influence outcomes and recommendations (Dube et al., 2007). \n\nAnother promising research area for model development and assessment is the use of  intensive, active surveillance programs, such as Columbia University's Virome of Manhattan  project (funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and National Institutes of  Health; Shaman, 2016). These testbeds may provide important insights not obtainable from  routine public health surveillance. Incorporation of genomic sequence data; human, animal, \n\n14  and environmental assessments; and machine learning and other promising approaches in  predictive model development could make such efforts especially powerful. \n\nTo support development of outbreak models, and identification and synthesis of results across  the most credible models, the Federal government should advance scientific and operational  capacities for meta‐analysis of outbreak modeling. Specifically, the WG recommends that the  Federal government, to the extent possible within existing authorities and resources: \n\nRecommendation 7: Enable Federal efforts to systematically identify outbreak modeling studies  as they become available; conduct controlled comparisons of models if source code is  accessible; assess the quality of models and modeling studies; and maintain current estimates  of key epidemiological and pathogen parameters through synthesis of modeling results. \n\nRecommendation 8: Strengthen communication and coordination between modeling groups  and Federal offices requiring outbreak decision support. \n\nRecommendation 9: Strengthen support for development of standards or best practices to  assess outbreak model attributes and performance. \n\nRecommendation 10: Strengthen support for controlled comparisons of outbreak modeling  approaches to identify preferred approaches for possible real‐world scenarios. \n\nRecommendation 11: Strengthen support for development of decision‐support methods and  tools to facilitate synthesis and adjudication of results across multiple models. \n\nRecommendation 12: Establish criteria for public release of outbreak model code developed  with Federal funds, and ensure that code that is appropriate for public release is shared  publicly, free of charge, no later than the time that the scientific paper describing the model is  published.  \n\nRecommendation 13: Establish active, population‐based surveillance testbeds for rigorous  development, comparison, and validation of infectious disease models (with first consideration  given to building modeling components into existing epidemiological surveillance or research  efforts).  \n\nScience of disease emergence. The two challenges described above pertain mainly to modeling  conducted after an outbreak has begun (or to a hypothetical outbreak). The third- understanding the processes that drive disease emergence and transmission well enough to  predict where and when diseases are likely to emerge-may be an even greater challenge.  Achieving this capability, however, promises tremendous rewards in life, economic prosperity,  and security. \n\nMost emerging infectious diseases affecting humans, including Zika, Ebola, MERS, pandemic  influenza, SARS, and other recent outbreaks of regional and global importance, are zoonotic.  Often, novel zoonotic pathogens are discovered only after they have caused outbreaks among  humans, when searches for the particular pathogen are targeted to candidate animal  reservoirs. The zoonotic pathogens that have spilled over into humans, though, represent only  a small fraction of the pool of potential pathogens circulating in animals. The size of this pool is  unknown, but one estimate by Federal scientists is that there are around 500,000 yet‐to‐be‐\n\n15  discovered viruses capable of infecting humans (Carroll, 2016). As the boundaries between  humans and animals decrease, the risk of zoonotic disease emergence will continue to increase. \n\nIntegrated, human‐animal modeling studies and efforts to discover potential pathogens are  critical for understanding the process of pathogen spillover from animals to humans. An  example is the U.S. Agency for International Development Emerging Pandemic Threats (EPT)  program, initiated in 2009 to pre‐empt zoonotic disease outbreaks or mitigate their impacts. In  collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Smithsonian Institution,  and non‐Federal partners, EPT supports projects in 20 countries to build regional, national, and  local \"One Health\" capacities for early detection, laboratory‐based diagnosis, rapid response  and containment, and risk reduction. One component of EPT, PREDICT, includes discovery of  zoonotic diseases at the wildlife‐human interface and development of predictive models for  disease emergence and spread. PREDICT has sampled more than 56,000 non‐human primates  in countries around the world and discovered more than 815 novel viruses. \n\nDiscovery of potential zoonotic pathogens is not sufficient, however, to understand the risk  they may pose to humans. There have been too few spatio‐temporal surveys to understand  transmission dynamics, particularly across multiple interacting species (for example, wildlife,  nearby domestic animals, and humans); and investigations of transmission dynamics between  humans and animals to which exposure may be especially high, such as companion animals and  animals used for food. Little also is known about how to predict whether a novel agent in a non‐ human reservoir possesses (or could acquire) the capability to infect humans, cause disease,  and be transmitted among humans; or about the interplay of biological, ecological,  environmental, and social‐behavioral factors in driving disease emergence.  \n\nTo advance public health towards the vision of pandemic prediction, the Federal government  should strengthen support for modeling R&D, especially in animals and at the human‐animal‐ environment interfaces. Specifically, the WG recommends that the Federal government, to the  extent possible within existing authorities and resources: \n\nRecommendation 14: Develop a \"One Health\" national strategy for predictive modeling of  potential infectious disease threats globally, encompassing human, animal, plant, and  environmental health priorities, science, and communities. \n\nUrgency of Action The next pandemic pathogen could emerge any day. Perhaps it already is circulating in a non‐ human reservoir, but has not yet had the opportunity to infect humans. Changes in climate,  ecosystems, or human settlements and behavior could provide that opportunity. Or perhaps it  will arise from a precursor microbe, after poorly‐understood evolutionary drivers bring about  the genomic changes necessary to infect and be transmitted among humans. The next outbreak  to devastate agriculture or ecosystems also could emerge at any time, and spread quickly  through a highly networked world. Interdisciplinary collaborations of mathematicians,  computer scientists, microbiologists, epidemiologists, veterinarians, and other scientists to  understand and predict these processes are not esoteric, academic pursuits. These  collaborations are vital investments that could provide tangible benefits to public health,  economic vitality, and security.  \n\n16 \n\nThe needed collaborations stretch well beyond the expertise and resources of any one part of  the Federal government, or of the Federal government as a whole. The PPFST WG will continue  its efforts to bring Federal agencies together, and join then with non‐Federal partners and civil  society, to advance outbreak modeling S&T, and catalyze its implementation against the rising  threat of emerging infectious diseases. \n\n   \n\n  17  Appendix 1 Recent Outbreaks Among Humans Caused by Zoonotic Viruses 1997‐present: Avian influenza (H5N1). The H5N1 avian influenza strain was discovered in birds  in China in 1996, and caused the first known human cases in Hong Kong in 1997. The 18 cases  appeared to have been infected by birds in live poultry markets; the outbreak ended with the  slaughter of all poultry in markets and farms in Hong Kong. Variants of the strain circulated in  poultry and wild birds in Asia, and caused disease in humans again beginning in 2003. Since  then, more than 850 human cases have been reported from 15 countries, and about half died  (there have been no reported infections in birds or humans in the United States). Most human  cases have been associated with contact with infected birds, although limited human‐to‐human  transmission likely has occurred rarely. In 2004‐2005, human case clusters and widespread  avian outbreaks in Asia prompted concerns of a pandemic and efforts globally to strengthen  surveillance and response capacity (WHO, 2005).        2003: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). A new disease first recognized in China in  February 2003, SARS reached North America, South America, Europe, and other parts of Asia,  with 8,096 cases and 774 deaths through July 2003. Most infections resulted from human‐to‐ human transmission linked to hospitals; infection control measures ended the outbreak. SARS  Coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) originated from similar viruses in bats. It crossed the species barrier to  infect civets and other animals in live‐animal markets, which transmitted the virus to humans  (de Wit et al., 2016).  2009‐2010: Pandemic influenza (H1N1). Typically a seasonal disease, influenza type A viruses  can cause pandemics when novel strains are transmitted from animals to humans and then  circulate among humans. Wild aquatic birds are the natural hosts of influenza A viruses and the  source of influenza viruses introduced into other mammals, such as pigs and chicken, which are,  in turn, important sources of novel strains in humans. The most recent influenza pandemic,  caused by an H1N1 strain in 2009‐2010, is estimated to have caused over 250,000 deaths  worldwide (Dawood et al., 2012) (for comparison, the most devastating influenza pandemic, in  1918, caused around 50 million deaths). The new 2009 strain resulted from reassortment of  pig, bird, and human influenza strains.  2012‐present: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). A new disease first recognized in  Saudi Arabia in 2012, MERS spread worldwide and continues to circulate as of September 2016,  with around 1,800 cases, about one‐third of them fatal. Most infections have resulted from  human‐to‐human transmission linked to hospitals. Like SARS‐CoV, MERS‐CoV originated from  similar viruses in bats. Its crossover to camels is estimated to have occurred more than 30 years  ago. Unlike SARS‐CoV, which infected but does not appear to have circulated among its  intermediate non‐human hosts (live‐marked animals), MERS CoV transmission occurs among  camels, resulting in more frequent introductions to humans (de Wit et al., 2016).   2013‐present: Chikungunya. First identified in 1950s in East Africa, Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is  transmitted by Aedes species mosquitoes and infects humans as well as non‐human primates  and other small mammals. The disease is rarely fatal in humans, but may cause fever and  debilitating joint pain. Chikugunya epidemiology changed recently, with outbreaks of \n\n  18  unprecedented size in Indian Ocean islands and India, and the first local transmission in Europe  and, in 2013, the Americas (with more than 1.7 million suspected cases in 45 countries,  including local transmission in Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as of September  2016). CHIKV genetic adaptation to Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which are widespread  globally, may have contributed to chikugunya's expanding range (Coffey et al., 2014).  2014‐2016: Ebola. Outbreaks of this viral hemorrhagic disease involve human‐to‐human  transmission after infection by wild animals, such as apes; bats are suspected as the natural  reservoir. The recent West Africa outbreak was the largest by far, with more than 28,000 cases  and 11,000 deaths; limited transmission occurred in the United States and Europe after return  of infected travelers. Previous outbreaks, dating to Ebola's discovery in 1976, occurred only in  equatorial Africa and were much smaller (fewer than 500 cases each). Factors contributing to  the West Africa outbreak include delayed recognition of a disease unfamiliar in the region, high  population mobility across borders, weak public health infrastructure, and community  resistance to control efforts (WHO, 2015b).  Zika: 2015‐present. Discovered in East Africa in 1947, Zika virus (ZIKV) is transmitted primarily  by mosquitoes (Aedes) and infects humans and other animals, primarily monkeys. Most  patients have no or mild symptoms. Emerging evidence indicates a sexual transmission route,  as well as rare neurological complications, including birth defects. Spillover from non‐human  hosts or limited transmission among humans caused small‐scale outbreaks in Africa and Asia.  The first large outbreak was reported in Yap Island (Federated States of Micronesia) in 2007,  with more than 100 cases. Local Zika transmission was reported in Brazil in 2015, for the first  time in the Western Hemisphere. The outbreak spread across the Americas and reached the  United States, with locally‐acquired cases in Puerto Rico (more than 13,000) and Florida (35)  (CDC, 2016b). Factors that may explain the unprecedented size, spatial extent, and clinical  impacts of the current outbreak remain under study.       \n\n  19  Appendix 2 PPFST WG Survey: Access to Data for Outbreak Science The Open Data action area, an interest group within the PPFST WG, has worked to characterize  and address the effect of data availability on the ability of Federal agencies and collaborators to  predict and respond to outbreaks. The Open Data group of PPFST developed and arranged for  the administration of a data collection tool to learn more about the existing levels of access to  data, effects of access on the ability to conduct outbreak science, and technical barriers to  access. The survey was administered to members of PPFST as well as both Federal employees  and academic researchers in the Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study of the National  Institutes of Health during the week of 30 August 2016. Eighteen surveys were returned to the  Open Data group of PPFST.    Survey respondents indicated that lack of access to data is severely hindering outbreak  preparedness and response duties. A hindrance index score combining the responses to all  survey items showed that lack of access to data created a hindrance to over half of outbreak  science efforts, on average. The hindrance index scores were created on a scale from 0 (no  hindrance) to 100 (maximum hindrance) and ranged from 18 (low hindrance) to 84 (high  hindrance), with a mean of 53.   Lack of access to existing data leads to delays and in some cases complete obstructions of  outbreak science efforts. Fifty‐six percent of respondents indicated that data non‐availability  delays their outbreak science work \"often\" or \"always\". Thirty‐three percent of respondents  said that data non‐availability \"often\" entirely prevents them from completing outbreak  science. Forty‐four percent of respondents had delayed or deferred a decision on outbreak  prediction and response efforts due to non‐availability of data.  Respondents indicated low confidence in the accuracy of data, reporting that they are only  confident in the accuracy of publicly available outbreak data less than half of the time on  average. Respondents indicated that on average, the data they need to produce infectious  disease outbreak models and analyses was publicly available in a timely fashion only less than  half of the time. One practitioner noted that this lack of open data availability delays infectious  disease short‐term forecasting efforts.    Situational awareness and context information needed to properly interpret data inputs and  build representative models are similarly lacking and were available to respondents through  public channels less than half of the time.   Respondents indicated that if existing data were more readily available, then researchers could  create more accurate, better resolved spatio‐temporal models of infectious diseases to predict  events such as Ebola hotspots. Outbreak genomic sequence information could help identify  optimal diagnostic assays and treatment plans for newly‐circulating strains. Access to BioWatch  databases, electronic health records, and real‐time medical claims data were suggested as  critical components of outbreak science efforts.   \n\n  20  One‐third of respondents cited technical considerations such as data formatting, standards,  procedures, or means of dissemination as a hindrance. Half of respondents suggested that the  government should use a standardized format when releasing data such as outbreak reports  publicly. In order to facilitate data distribution and use, about half of respondents suggested  that the government should use a standardized format such as XML files for distribution, with a  preference for no distribution restrictions.   Based on these findings, the Open Data group of PPFST recommends that further action be  taken across the Interagency to expand public availability of detailed, highly spatially resolved  population health and laboratory data in standardized formats in near real‐time.  \n\n  21  References Biggerstaff M, Alper D, Drezde M, et al. 2016.
