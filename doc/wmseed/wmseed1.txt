According to the latest IPC analysis, famine conditions, previously
reported in February 2017 in former Leer and Mayendit counties in
former Unity State, were no longer occurring by late June 2017.
Overall, the number of people facing IPC Phase 5: "Catastrophe" food
security conditions declined from over 100 000 in February to about
45 000 in June due to sustained multi-sectoral humanitarian
assistance operations and the two counties are currently classified
as IPC Phase 4: "Emergency".
