However, nationwide, the food insecure caseload (IPC Phases 3, 4 and 5)
increased from about 5 million in February to a record high of 6
million in June as food access continues to be severely constrained by
widespread insecurity, large scale displacements, high food prices,
market disruptions, macro-economic collapse and exhaustion of
households' coping mechanisms. The areas of major concern are Greater
Jonglei and Unity states, where over 60 percent of the population faces
"Crisis", "Emergency" and "Catastrophe" levels of food insecurity. In
particular, the people facing catastrophic conditions are located in
Ayod County in Greater Jonglei State and in Leer, Koch and Mayendit
counties in Unity State.
